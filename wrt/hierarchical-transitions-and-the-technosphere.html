          <br>
          Last year I had the opportunity to attend an Environmental Humanities graduate seminar at the University of British Columbia with 
          <a href="https://mcmaster.academia.edu/DerekWoods">Derek Woods</a>. While I was unable to register due to a full course load,
          I dropped in on a single session where the topic of discussion was ‚ÄúPlanetary Technics.‚Äù During the seminar I began contemplating some 
          hazy connections between certain themes relating to a paper we read about large-scale technological systems (which I‚Äôll introduce in the 
          following section) and some ideas in theoretical biology regarding the dynamics of collective interaction and major hierarchic 
          transitions. The following text attempts to flesh out these conceptual relationships in more detail. 
        <p>
          This piece is a work in progress. Initially, I only intended to engage with two resources, one text and one lecture, putting them in 
          dialogue with one another to tease out their similarities and chart future research directions. Naturally, as I was writing I encountered
          new references that complemented this project and new texts, ideas, and thinkers began to orbit around my efforts. While far from complete, 
          I‚Äôve done my best to integrate some of these new resources into the following piece. Unlike a polished text with a focused narrative,
          my writing here is an attempt to feel my way through a set of ideas, documenting my thoughts as I piece them together. My hope is that 
          I‚Äôll continue to develop and refine this line of thinking long after this piece has been shared with you here, 
          especially as it has become increasingly apparent that this topic is much richer than I‚Äôd first imagined.

        <p style="font-size: 30px; padding-bottom: 5px; border-bottom: 1.5px dotted black">Introducing the Technosphere
        <p>
          The readings for the seminar that week touched on a range of topics relating to technology, media, geology, ecology, 
          capitalism, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere">noosphere</a>. Among them was 
          <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053019614530575">Humans and Technology in the Anthropocene: Six Rules</a>, a fascinating 
          paper on the quasi-autonomous dynamics of planetary-scale technological systems, authored by Emeritus Professor of Geology and Civil and 
          Environmental Engineering, <a href="https://cee.duke.edu/faculty/peter-haff">Peter Haff</a>. 
          In the text, Haff attempts to encapsulate said dynamics using the following six rules:
        <p>
        <p style="margin-left: 30px"> 
          ‚ë† The rule of inaccessibility 
          <br>
          ‚ë° The rule of impotence 
          <br>
          ‚ë¢ The rule of control 
          <br> 
          ‚ë£ The rule of reciprocity 
          <br> 
          ‚ë§ The rule of performance 
          <br>
          ‚ë• The rule of provision 
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of these rules is meant to express an important feature of large-scale, hierarchically-nested or stratified technological systems while also defining 
          how humans are compelled to operate in relation to them. Those looking for a more comprehensive account of these rules are encouraged to consult the entire 
          paper (linked above) as this piece will not discuss them in great detail. In a nutshell, however, they can be summarized by the following:
        <p>
        <p style="margin-left: 30px"> 
          ‚ë† Inaccessibility: Differences in size or scale of two or more systems strongly limits precise interactions between their local variables.
          <br>
          ‚ë° Impotence: Larger scale systems constrain lower-tier components and are therefore generally unresponsive to most behavior of these nested subsystems.
          <br>
          ‚ë¢ Control: No individual part may directly control or cause a system's behaviour but can act in such a way to more effectively enable the system to maintain viability.
          <br> 
          ‚ë£ Reciprocity: Symmetrical interactions between two or more systems are limited to those sharing the same stratum or scale. 
          <br> 
          ‚ë§ Performance: Some actions of most system parts are compelled to support the function of the system to which they belong. 
          <br>
          ‚ë• Provision: Higher-stratum systems contribute to the maintenance of a suitable environment for their components so as to enable their support function behaviour. 
        </p>
        <p>  
          Now, there are evidently many ways to interpret something as broad as a planetary-scale or large-scale technological system. Indeed, comparable 
          forms of this general idea‚Äì‚Äìi.e. a global sphere produced by and consisting of aspects of human reason, scientific knowledge, and technological development‚Äì‚Äìhave
          been explored before through concepts like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthroposphere">Anthroposphere</a>, 
          <a href="https://www.sociostudies.org/almanac/articles/conceptions_of_a_global_brain_an_historical_review/">Metaman, Conscious-Technology, The Global Brain</a>, 
          and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere">Noosphere</a>. 
          Haff‚Äôs specific formulation of this idea is what he calls the <i>technosphere</i>. I'll begin with some descriptions of this term to set the stage for the 
          connections I‚Äôm interested in exploring between Haff's work and the idea of hierarchic transitions in biology.
        <p>
          In an academic context, the word ‚Äútechnosphere‚Äù can be traced back to a <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1109/MSPEC.1968.5214690">
          1968 text</a> by biomedical engineer and biological control-theory researcher J. H. Milsum, although Haff has made the term his 
          own through a number of publications in the last decade or so (e.g. see <a href="www.pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/Haff 2013 Technology as a Geological Phenomenon.pdf">
          1</a> and <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1177/2053019616677743">2</a>), many of which being thematically allied with a growing literature on 
          the Anthropocene. For Haff, the technosphere is said to be the technological analogue to the various natural geological paradigms or 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_Earth_sciences#Earth's_spheres">planetary spheres</a> that constitute and sustain the Earth 
          system, such as the geosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, or the biosphere. Haff notes, for instance, that all of the aforementioned 
          systems are global in their extent, autonomous to some degree, and involve the widespread appropriation of resources. General commonalities
          aside, a more specific albeit contracted description of the technosphere is as follows:
        <p style="margin-left: 30px">
          A global interconnected system of 
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px">

          <br>
          ‚óæ Social structures
          <br>        
          ‚óæ Physical infrastructure 
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 30px">
          which constitute
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px">
          ‚óæ The totality of the built human environment
          <br>
          ‚óæ The particular energy and resource transformations underpinning the system‚Äôs ‚Äúmetabolic‚Äù profile
          <br>        
          ‚óæ The emergent principles that govern our relationship with it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Per this definition, the technosphere is not simply the aggregate of all technological objects‚Äì‚Äìmuch like the biosphere is not the 
          mere sum of all planetary biomass‚Äì‚Äìbut rather has dynamic emergent properties that result from the organization of its various components 
          and the associations between them, including constraints, incentives, deterrents, and other relational processes associated with the system‚Äôs 
          functioning. This central characterization of a complex system such as the technosphere or the biosphere is to be clearly understood and 
          we‚Äôll return to this point in a moment. 
        <p>
          We can get a richer, more extensive view of what is meant by the technosphere in Haff's own words in following passage from a 2014 text 
          titled <a href="https://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/Haff 2013 Technology as a Geological Phenomenon.pdf">Technology as a Geological Phenomenon: 
          Implications for Human Well-Being</a>:
        <p class="quote">
          ‚Äú[The technosphere is]‚Ä¶the set of large-scale networked technologies that underlie and make possible rapid extraction from the Earth of large 
          quantities of free energy and subsequent power generation, long distance, nearly instantaneous communication, rapid long-distance energy and 
          mass transport, the existence and operation of modern governmental and other bureaucracies, high-intensity industrial and manufacturing 
          operations including regional, continental and global distribution of food and other goods, and a myriad additional ‚Äòartificial‚Äô or 
          ‚Äònon-natural‚Äô processes without which modern civilization and its present 7 √ó 109 human constituents could not exist. If the term 
          ‚Äòanthroposphere‚Äô is meant to emphasize the role of human beings as causative agents responsible for Earth transformations that define the 
          Anthropocene, the use of ‚Äòtechnosphere‚Äô suggests a more detached view of an emerging geological process that has entrained humans as 
          essential components that support its dynamics.‚Äù  
        </p>
        <p>
          Haff once more, from the more recent article which we read in the seminar: 
        <p class="quote">
          ‚ÄúThe technosphere includes the world‚Äôs large-scale energy and resource extraction systems, power generation and transmission systems, communication,
          transportation, financial and other networks, governments and bureaucracies, cities, factories, farms and myriad other ‚Äòbuilt‚Äô systems, as well
          as all the parts of these systems, including computers, windows, tractors, office memos and humans. It also includes systems which traditionally
          we think of as social or human-dominated, such as religious institutions or NGOs. The Haber-Bosch process and associated technologies, 
          responsible through synthetic fixation of nitrogen and distribution of resulting fertilizers for providing about 40% of the world‚Äôs dietary 
          protein (Smil, 2002), is a specific example of a globally distributed component of the technosphere.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          These excerpts highlight the many energetic, informational, productional, and logistical processes enabled by our planetary technological system
          as well as some concrete examples of the interrelated artifactual 
          subsystems which the technosphere comprises, i.e. the various contemporary networked technologies nested within the global system. Both these 
          aspects (built artifactual systems and the myriad dynamic processes they facilitate) are part and parcel of the descriptions above and draw our attention 
          to the sheer scale of the technosphere and the scope of what component subsystems and processes constitute this technological system. From relatively 
          simple products like office memos and fertilizer, to complex intergenerational
          socio-cultural forms like religious institutions, cities, and governments, the magnitude of the technosphere is vast and totalizing, assimilating 
          nearly all phenomena connected to the workings of contemporary human civilization, including the behaviour of human subjects themselves.
        <p>
          This leads us directly to one of the central aspects of Haff‚Äôs theory of large-scale technological networks: his insistence on a shift in our 
          thinking away from the ‚Äúnatural assumption that the technosphere is primarily a human-created and controlled system‚Äù and towards ‚Äúthe idea that 
          the workings of modern humanity are a product of a system that operates beyond our control and that imposes its own requirements on human 
          behaviour.‚Äù Put more plainly: "...humans are components of a larger sphere they did not design, do not understand, do not control and from which 
          they cannot escape.." Haff notes that similar positions have been articulated before in other scholarly contexts, particularly by political 
          and social theorists, such as <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262730495/autonomous-technology/">Langdon Winner</a> and 
          <a href="https://ia803209.us.archive.org/2/items/JacquesEllulTheTechnologicalSociety/Jacques%20Ellul%20-%20The%20Technological%20Society.pdf">
          Jacques Ellul</a>, who have written about the emergence of modern autonomous technological systems and 
          "whose works go a long way toward disabusing the notion that humans operate as independent agents in the modern technological world."  
        <p>  
          One way of thinking about this relationship between human agents and the technosphere is to frame it in terms of how the properties of <i>organization</i>
          and <i>constraint</i> operate in complex systems. Haff devotes a section to these ideas, which I will expand on in more detail once we get into the biology 
          of hierarchic transitions. For now it will suffice to say that the general idea is that for a complex dynamic system to persist through time and space, 
          that is, to maintain some systemic coherent unity at a relevant temporal and spatial scale,  
          most of its component parts and processes must behave, and be organized in relation to one another, in a manner that is consistent with the system‚Äôs
          ability to reproduce itself as a unity. In other words, <i>systemic consistency and robustness requires functional organization, implying constraints
          on the degrees of freedom accessible to constituent components</i>. 
        <p>
          Once we're committed to conceiving of the technosphere as a higher-level unity defined by organizational relations between coupled subsystems, 
          we can begin to see how the interests of human agents, as subordinate elements of the macro-system, must be constrained to some extent to 
          align with the properties and/or emergent principles of the complex dynamic system within which they are embedded. Haff's 2014 text supplies us
          with some examples of what these constraints could be, ranging from "hard" and tangible constraints like 
          architectural and infrastructural barriers, to "soft" and more abstract or normative regulations, such as incentives and deterrents for 
          behaviour that supports or interferes with the functioning of a given host system. Taken together, these features of the technosphere are
          reflected in the first 4 rules: planetary scale, distributed systemic functionality (control) and organizational constraint (impotence) inhibits 
          direct causal interactions between different strata (inaccessibility) of a large, complex, dynamic technological system, and such a system may only 
          be affected by other systems which inhabit comparable scales and are capable therefore of mutually interaction (reciprocity).     
        <p>   
          Importantly, the intertwining of humans and the technosphere also means that we are increasingly reliant upon its functioning to support our 
          well-being and continuation as a species. For instance, Haff puts forth the following estimation to really drive home the extent to which 
          contemporary human populations are beholden to the organizational constraints, and affordances, of large-scale 
          technological systems: "the pre-Anthropocene, pre-technological ‚Ä¶ human population was perhaps 10 million"
          and "the ramp-up of technology from pre-history through, e.g., dynastic China, Rome and medieval Europe to today‚Äôs global technology has led to 
          the expansion of this population to a level approaching 10 billion today ‚Ä¶ suggesting that on the order of 999 out of every 1000 humans owe their 
          existence and their wellbeing to technological systems." 
        <p>
          Conceived of as an emerging geological process, Haff's emphasis on the quasi-autonomous property of the technosphere frames
          how our networked technological systems interface with other Anthropocene-related phenomena in a manner which understates human autonomy over the 
          production and transformation of the built environment. 
          After all, the Anthropocene denotes a geological epoch where significant impacts on the planet's climate and ecosystems are 
          the result of the activity of humankind, and therefore part of the uniqueness of Haff‚Äôs contribution to such discourse is to invert the 
          directionality of this causal relation. As Haff writes: "The technosphere is a system for which humans are essential but, nonetheless, 
          subordinate parts ‚Ä¶ This does not mean that humans cannot influence its behavior, but that the technosphere will tend to resist attempts to 
          compromise its function." Haff again: "humans have become entrained within the matrix of technology and are now borne along by a supervening 
          dynamics from which they cannot simultaneously escape and survive." 
        <p> 
          However as we'll see, the general framework of this perspective‚Äì‚Äìthat the emergent dynamics
          of the technosphere restrict and recruit human action to mutually support continued functioning of the resultant macrosystem‚Äì‚Äìwill also be crucial to 
          connecting this novel planetary-scale paradigm with certain evolutionary principles of biological complexity facilitated by hierarchical constraint,
          possibly providing new insight into both. 
        <p>
          To summarize: the technosphere is a composite system and planetary paradigm comparable to other geological phenomena. Its components include 
          everything from biological organisms to technological artifacts, social institutions, and emergent relational processes which both 
          enable and are enabled by the global system. These organizational constraints play a significant role in ensuring the reciprocal survival and functioning 
          of both the whole system and its natural and artificial components. Conceptualizing the nature of large-scale technological systems in the aforementioned 
          manner might also illuminate equivalences 
          between the dynamics of the emerging technosphere and certain hierarchically-nested biological systems.   
        <p>
          The remainder of this text will focus on drawing comparisons between these principles, some of Haff's rules, and the ideas of <a href="https://anthropology.berkeley.edu/terrence-w-deacon">
          Terrence Deacon</a> and <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/dmcshea">Daniel McShea</a> regarding evolutionary synergies, hierarchic
          transitions in coupled systems, and the transformations in complexity and autonomy that accompany such processes. In order to make
          these connections, and clarify some of the terms I‚Äôve just introduced, I turn to some key points from 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWMEnIYEaQQ">a talk</a> that Deacon gave in 2017, as well as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36075549/">
          a paper</a> published in 2022, each pertaining to the subject of hierarchic transitions in biological evolution.

          <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/evos/">Evolutionary Studies Program</a>. I've also discovered more recently that the ideas Deacon covered in 
          this talk have also been articulated in a 2022 article in the journal Biosystems titled <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36075549/">A 
          Degenerative Process Underlying Hierarchic Transitions in Evolution</a>. In both these resources, Deacon speculates on how the hierarchic 
          complexity of organismal structure, function, and form are generated through evolutionary processes. Generally speaking, hierarchic complexity is 
          a term used here to describe a biological phenomenon whereby numerous autonomous living entities develop co-dependent or synergistic behaviours 
          with the collective relations of an emergent system, sometimes comprised of two or more coupled systems, and often leading to the stabilization 
          of new macro-scale biological units (such as pluricellular or multicellular organisms). Hierarchic complexity also denotes what some believe to 
          be a resultant decrease in the functional autonomy of the novel system's constituent entities that occupy lower-tier strata relative to the emergent 
          global whole. Owing in part to the lack of any widely accepted theory of how such transformations in hierarchic complexity occur, Deacon has 
          developed his own framework for thinking about how these organizational and morphological features of living systems emerge at various scales, 
          and how this process might be implicated in <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-major-transitions-in-evolution-9780198502944">
          evolutionary developments such as transitions in individuality</a>. Much like Haff's work on the technosphere, Deacon's theory of hierarchic 
          complexity reflects a similar concern for principles of organization and constraint, distributed functionality, and gradations of 
          autonomy across multiple scales of complex hierarchically-structured systems.  
        <p>
          Deacon's thoughts on this topic are contributions to an existing body of modern literature on the phenomenon of hierarchical transitions, or evolutionary 
          transitions in individuality, that is nearly a century and a half old. As mentioned above, this is a process by which 
          groups of discrete organisms collectively form higher-level aggregate entities or novel concrete biological individuals. In this context, 
          a biological entity or individual refers to: <i>a temporally-enduring spatially-individuated being with properties or 
          functions such as feeding, reproduction, and self-preservation that belong to the system at the highest-level</i>. A broad range of examples can be 
          used to illustrate this idea, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiogenesis">origin of eukaryotic cells via prokaryotic symbiosis</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism#Origin_hypotheses">multicellular entities arising from unicellular organisms</a>, and 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superorganism">colonies formed from pluricellular individuals</a>. An early treatment of this topic in the 
          modern history of biology can be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a>'s 19th c. works

        <p>
          In his lecture, Deacon first sets out to address what he sees as a contradiction in ‚Äúreplicator-selection stories‚Äù of evolution, i.e. explanations 
          of evolutionary phenomena most commonly associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene">selfish gene theory</a>. Deacon 
          posits that replicator-selection theories mistakenly overemphasize absolute autonomy and controlled replication as the primary and conserved features 
          underpinning evolving biological systems, instantiated in what is thought to be the most fundamental causal unit of the organism: the genetic components 
          of individual cells. Deacon reasons, however, that the existence of evolving hierarchically-complex living systems implies coordination and regulation 
          across a multitude of intraorganismal and extra-cellular spatial and temporal scales, and that the autonomy of the constituents of such systems, and 
          the degree of control they can exercise, must therefore be relinquished to some degree if synergies between these various interdependent levels are to 
          develop at all. In his most recent paper, Deacon substantiates this point by drawing from a 2017 article titled <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519316304349">
          On the Developmental Self-Regulatory Dynamics and Evolution of Individuated Multicellular Organisms</a>, written by theoretical biologist Felipe Veloso, 
          who Deacon believes ‚Äúunambiguously demonstrates that the development of multicellular animals depends on a shift of control from intracellular 
          genetic constraints to extra-cellular relational constraints that emerge at the organism level.‚Äù
        <p>
          To further develop this perspective, Deacon turns to the important work of evolutionary biologist Leo Buss, and the phenomena of multicellular 
          individuality in plants, animals, and fungi, to provide examples of a class of systems which favour sophisticated cooperation and exhibit autonomy-limiting 
          properties at various scales of their organization. For instance, Deacon describes how fungi enable cellular cooperation via cell membranes which are 
          porous enough to favor widespread homogeneity in cell-type and tissues. The logic here is that having cell membranes with greater permeability makes it 
          difficult to correlate the influence of a set of genes, or a genome, with controlled effects in the immediate surroundings of its local nucleus, 
          rather than that of neighbouring cells. In other words, if the membrane cannot reliably regulate what enters and leaves the cell, gene products can have
          effects both inside and outside the cell in an untargeted manner, nullifying any strong demarcation between one cell and any other. As a result, from any 
          individual cell's "point of view", it is unfeasible to guarantee whether their genes will be the ones reproduced in the fruiting body. 
          Cooperative reproductive behaviour among cells may then emerge as a compensatory mechanism for 
          this constraint on the absolute reproductive autonomy of any given cell in the collective. In the case of plants, he points to the structural limitations 
          of rigid cell walls and their role in restricting movement and fostering highly deterministic cell fates. This is a more coercive evolutionary strategy 
          than that of fungal organisms, but nonetheless facilitates systemic cohesion while dampening cellular autonomy. Briefly put: multicellular synergistic 
          cooperation among cellular components ‚Äúis accomplished in fungi by preventing genetic determination of distinct tissue types, in plants by eliminating 
          mobility of cells, and in animals by determination of cell lineage fates by maternal factors prior to cell-specific gene expression.‚Äù In all cases, 
          multicellular eukaryotic systems are thought to have achieved stabilized individuation in part by preventing any given cell from fully 
          and independently determining whether it can replicate or persist alone. Without this constraint, the integrity of the global system is likely 
          to be compromised by selfish unfettered replication, such as that which occurs during cancerous cell growth. 
        <p>
          Here we return to the description I began to sketch in the previous section about organization and constraint in dynamic systems. Both Haff and Deacon‚Äì‚Äìas well 
          as many of those working on the question of hierarchic transitions more generally‚Äì‚Äìare tapping into a very similar framework for thinking about related 
          phenomena in biological and social reality. Much like the dynamics of multicellularity then, the technosphere and its dynamics can be viewed as a hierarchical 
          system that exploits similar principles of constraint in its organizational constitution to ensure the reciprocal and synergistic functioning of an emergent global 
          whole relative to its parts, irrespective of the material basis of the components. One principal difference, however, between Haff and Deacon is that the former 
          focuses mostly on an analysis of how such systems <i>work</i>, while the latter is providing a theory for how such systems <i>got to be that way</i>.
        <p>
          Deacon's question, then, is ultimately an evolutionary, or perhaps historical, one: i.e. <i>how, then, might any form of synergistic cooperation underpinning 
          hierarchically-organized biological systems, and the implicit constraints on autonomy that result from such organization, occur in the first
          place?</i> Deacon attempts to address this with the following proposal: 
        <p style="margin-left: 30px">
          ‚óæ In biology, environmental changes, as well as certain intra-organismal dynamics, can alter the selection pressures maintaining a particular trait. 
          When the efficacy of a source of selection is weakened or eliminated entirely this is termed <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/j.tree.2009.03.010">
          'relaxed selection'</a>, and can lead to the reduction or loss of traits and/or functions. In some cases, however, it can instigate biological novelty.
          <br>
          ‚óæ Building on the latter of these two outcomes, Deacon speculates that if selection is relaxed on some functional trait of a system or 
          entity (let's say system or entity 'A'), this opens a space of possibility, outside the scope of selection pressures, for random explorations
          of unprecedented interactions between 'A' and other, often molecular, system or entity ('B').
          <br> 
          ‚óæ Should advantageous functionality emerge as a result of 'A' and 'B's interactivity, selection pressure can now shift to target the synergistic
          composite of 'A', 'B' and their relationality, amplifying their mutual dependency.
          <br> 
          ‚óæ As this relationship develops, adaptively valuable functions once carried out independently by 'A' and/or 'B' may now become transformed, or distributed 
          across the interactions of the emergent coupled system, becoming increasingly constituted and selected for at this higher level of organization involving how 'A' 
          and 'B' interact synergistically. 
          <br> 
          ‚óæ Furthermore, as this coupling is strengthened through selection over evolutionary time, 'A' and/or 'B' will progressively assume the functional 
          role of a component in the context of the larger novel macro-system. 
        </p>
        Importantly, Deacon submits that this new hierarchically-organized system with synergistic,
        distributed functionality is only sustainable if its development ensures that the loss of autonomy occurring at the lower levels of the constituent 
        parts is also beneficial for said components, and that this benefit is sufficient to sustain the integrant subsystems' ability to perform 
        support functions and contribute to the persistence and maintenance of higher-level functionality and macro-systemic or global order. This point will 
        be especially salient as we dive into Haff's rules ‚ë§ and ‚ë• in later sections. In the meantime, my hope is that the reader has begun to see an image taking shape of 
        the conceptual resemblances between Haff and Deacon's perspectives, each an analysis of emergent hierarchically-organized systems where control and 
        functionality are distributed across the collective relations of components whose existence and autonomy has become subordinated to, and 
        dependent on, global identity and constraint.       
        <p>
          To contrast with the slightly more abstract theorization in the previous paragraphs, the following sections turn to some specific examples 
          of relaxed selection and hierarchical transitions which Deacon uses to clarify and support this theory.

        <p style="font-size: 30px; padding-bottom: 5px; border-bottom: 1.5px dotted black">Intrinsic Duplication and Ancestral Haemoglobin
        <p>
          To build his case, Deacon must establish an explanation of the scale-invariant continuity of this process of relaxed selection and hierarchic 
          complexity, beginning at the molecular, or <i>intrinsic</i> scale, and moving towards the <i>extrinsic</i> scale of intercellular and 
          extra-organismal dynamics. A representative case of one circumstance known to facilitate relaxed selection at the molecular scale is 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_duplication">gene duplication</a> 
          or polyploidy, wherein "genes or genomes replicate such that selection can act on one copy but is relaxed on the other." Gene duplication has been 
          hypothesized to play an important role in the evolution of biological novelty through the generation of redundant loci which become free to explore 
          non-deleterious transformations in phenotypic structure and/or functions‚Äì‚Äìa ‚Äúrandom walk‚Äù away from the original function‚Äì‚Äìwhile a duplicate gene 
          continues to perform essential ancestral tasks. Deacon speaks to this process in greater detail in his 2022 Biosystems article: 
        <p class="quote">
          "[non-deleterious point mutations in a gene duplicate] may result in a progressive loss of the specificity of protein function, with some functional 
          associations being lost while other related interactions 
          maintained. Whereas the initial evolution of protein function may involve structural compromises to accommodate its multiple associations to other 
          molecules, multiple variant forms may provide a ‚Äúhave your cake and eat it too‚Äù option, with each variant form able to evolve greater specificity for 
          one or another of these sub-functional capacities. In other words, the duplication, relaxation of selection, and random walk can provide a kind of 
          exploration of the space of possible synergistic relationships that lie, in effect, in the ‚Äúfunction space‚Äù just adjacent to an existing function. This 
          is a recipe for increasing functional complexity."
        </p>
        <p>
          In Deacon's view, the underlying principles shaping this process of intrinsic duplication, relaxed selection, and random walk, and the exploration
          of possible synergistic relations in a novel function space that it engenders, can be generalized and expanded to encompass analogous processes
          occurring extrinsic to biological entities as well. That is to say, while intrinsic duplication operates at genetic, 
          molecular, and regulatory levels, Deacon conjectures that extrinsic duplication can also occur at organismal and social scales. 
          This will be key to understanding the links between Deacon's theoretical considerations and hierarchical constraint in planetary technological systems. 
          In his lecture, Deacon provides numerous examples of intrinsic duplication involving synergies among haemoglobin variants, the acetylcholine receptors 
          that compose an ion channel, and regulatory genes shaping body-plan segmentation, to name a few. In his more recent paper he focuses solely on a subset 
          of these, one of which I'll summarize quickly before proceeding to describe extrinsic duplication.
        <p>
          In the case of the globin gene family, Deacon discusses how selection may have become relaxed for duplicate descendants of an ancestral haemoglobin
          gene, allowing mutations to accrue in less evolutionarily-conserved structural elements (as opposed to, say, genes associated with the shape of the 
          oxygen-binding element). Over time, certain structural variations in ancestral haemoglobin populations afforded the possibility for a synergistic 
          complementarity between variants to arise, such that two novel molecular structures (Œ± and Œ≤ haemoglobin) eventually found themselves capable 
          of binding with one another, producing a tetramer capable of carrying not one but four iron atoms, enabling superior oxygen transportation 
          throughout the vascular system. 
        <p>  
          In this prototypical example of a hierarchic transition via intrinsic duplication, "the alpha and beta hemoglobin duplicates each acquired independent 
          changes in shape but minimal changes in oxygen binding capacity in their separate divergence from the original ‚Äúancestral‚Äù hemoglobin gene. Changes 
          that increased the stability of tetrameric binding appear to have been favored by natural selection with respect to one another, probably because of 
          the superior oxygen transport capacity of the tetrahedral form." In other words, as relaxed selection facilitated sampling for combinations of the 
          two systems (interactive structural coupling of alpha and beta haemoglobin), this in turn could enable selection to target and stabilize a 
          synergistic, higher-level function (amplified oxygen transportation), distributed globally across a new coupled system (haemoglobin tetramer).

        <p>
          Deacon‚Äôs notion of hierarchic complexity via extrinsic duplication finally brings us outside the intracellular realm of molecular variation and 
          structural coupling into a domain of complex coupled interactions between organisms and/or environmental changes, while bridging both. In both resources 
          referenced in this text, Deacon provides a number of examples to flesh out his notion of extrinsic duplication, including 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiogenesis">endosymbiosis</a>, 
          <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/science/vitamins-old-old-edge.html">exogenous Vitamin C intake and a loss of function of the GULO gene</a>, 
          the emergence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusociality">eusocial collectives</a> and the diminished 
          autonomy of component organisms, and the development of language in humans and song structure in finches. Unlike intrinsic duplication, which often involves 
          genetic, structural, or segmental duplications internal to the biological system, many of these cases involve interactions between an organism and an external 
          and duplicate source of an intrinsic function. Quoting Deacon at length in his discussion of the transition from the endogenous metabolic synthesis of 
          ascorbic acid to exogenous dietary dependency in anthropoid primates: 
        <p class="quote">
          "...reduced selection on the intrinsic function that is thereby provided with redundant support from 
          outside will allow the intrinsic capacity to degrade..." and "...selection can be redistributed fractionally across highly diverse, and previously independent, 
          genetic loci and epigenetic mechanisms ... extrinsic ascorbic acid dependency provides us with an opportunity to look at some of the secondary consequences of 
          this degradation. The reduction of purifying selection maintaining this enzyme in turn would have unmasked selection on a variety of other traits that help 
          guarantee the availability of this now essential nutrient. Thus, the behavioral flexibility that initially allowed primates to regularly forage on fruit 
          eventually ‚Äúaddicted‚Äù anthropoid primates to a dietary niche in which fruit acquisition and digestion were critical. Degradation of this gene and its function 
          would have unmasked selection on many diverse traits that coincidentally supported this ‚Äúaddiction.‚Äù These likely included the capacity to judge the ripeness 
          of fruit (e.g., by the evolution of three-color vision), forage on the outer limbs of trees (e.g. by arboreal locomotor adaptations), find the sugar-rich and 
          slightly acidic content of fruit attractive (e.g. taste receptor changes), and metabolize the sugars and tolerate the ethanol that over-ripe fruits contain 
          (e.g. by changes in liver enzymes). All of these could be considered part of an adaptive suite for guaranteeing the supply of ascorbic acid."
        </p>  
          In other words, if relaxed selection takes place for ancestral, primarily genetic loci whose associated function has now been 
          externally replicated by a suite of inter-organismal or environmental relations, the mechanisms underpinning this function can diversify and become distributed 
          across a broader synergistic aggregate of genetic, epigenetic, behavioural, and/or environmental systems and relations. Furthermore, this adaptive suite of coupled
          subsystems supplies a target for selection to act upon, facilitating stabilizing effects at the higher level of the whole novel emergent system. 
        <p>
          The figure below depicts a oversimplified schematic of this phenomenon, whereby a gene or set of genes (Gene(s) 4) that once corresponded 
          directly to a phenotype (Function 4) will degrade as a result of relaxed selection owing to the presence of an external, duplicate function (Environmental Duplication). 
          Selective pressures are now distributed across any and all loci (Function 1, Function 5, Function 1B, Function 5B) with operational roles sustaining the exogenous source 
          for the target function. 
        <br>
        <img class="txtimg" src="edDiagram.jpeg">
        Once again, we end up with the emergence and stabilization of a new synergistically-constituted systemic order whose viability is maintained through organizational 
          constraints on the autonomy or functional independence of the elements that comprise this new adaptive suite of relations. Notably, these elements are not confined
          to the interior of a biological system, like a cell, but involve coupling of intra-organismal and environmental or exo-organismal variables. These assorted 
          elements‚Äì‚Äìfrom molecular to organismal behaviour, exogenous effects, and relations with an environment or between living systems‚Äì‚Äìhave now been effectively recruited 
          as component parts providing support functions for a higher-level hierarchical system. From the perspective of the macrosystem enabled by this transition in hierarchic 
          complexity, these elements are, in some sense, what Haff might call ‚Äúessential but, nonetheless, subordinate parts.‚Äù    
        <p>  
          The general application of this principle to major hierarchic transitions in biological evolution, or as Deacon puts it, the identification of a "generic 
          sequence of phases in the evolutionary process..." which describe "a trajectory that is common to ... major biological transitions", brings us 
          to two much-discussed phenomena in the literature of theoretical biology: endosymbiosis and multicellularity. Indeed, these examples sharply highlight 
          the constraints on autonomy experienced by subordinate parts as a result of their integration into an emergent system through the process of hierarchical transition, and 
          gives a clearer sense of the implications this understanding has for interpreting the ongoing development of the technosphere.

          Obligate endosymbionts, particularly mitochondria, are ideal systems for thinking through the similarities between Haff‚Äôs rules and Deacon‚Äôs hierarchic complexity. There is
          an extensive literature on the evolution of mitochondria, the organelles that synthesize ATP (the so-called ‚Äòenergy currency of the cell‚Äô) which powers a myriad 
          of biochemical and physiological processes in nearly all eurakyrotic organisms. However, for our purposes, I will provide only a truncated description of what is known as mitochondrial 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiogenesis">symbiogenesis</a> or the <i>endosymbiotic theory of origin</i>. According to this theory‚Äì‚Äìpopularized and substantiated by 
          evolutionary biologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Margulis">Lynn Margulis</a> following a resurgence in the idea of symbiogenesis in the 1960s‚Äì‚Äìorganelles in 
          eukaryotic cells, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, are thought to have once been free-living microbes which developed obligate endosymbiotic relationships 
          with some proto-eukaryotic host-cells. In other words, one set of once-independent organisms were engulfed by another, and each came to depend on the other for their survival. 
          As the energy-producing properties of these microbes became increasingly valuable to the functioning of the host cell they were progressively assimilated into the 
          whole proto-eukaryotic cellular system. Over evolutionary time, these micro-organisms are thought to have transitioned from autonomous living entities to endosymbionts, and finally organelles.
          Some proposed reasons for this evolutionary development include:

          ‚óæ The advantage conferred by possessing multiple energy producing units within a single cell
          <br>
          ‚óæ Genomic degradation of both ancestral subsystems of the nascent eukaryotic cell 
          <br>
          ‚óæ A considerable loss of autonomy at the level of the former prokaryote 
          <br>
          ‚óæ The increasingly coupled, distributed functioning of the new unified macro-system. 
        <p>
          Deacon highlights some of these features in his presentation and paper, noting <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2014.0330">estimates</a> "that mitochondria have 
          lost as much as 99% of the functional genes typically present in their bacterial ancestors" with many of these genes being transposed to the nuclear genome as a result of this transition. 
          Many proteins critical to organelle functioning are now produced by nuclear genes, while some nuclear genes have degraded as a result of organelles performing certain metabolic 
          functions for the cell. Deacon is certainly not the only person to articulate to this.¬†In fact, it is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg1271">relatively well understood</a> 
          that the mitochondrial genome is dramatically smaller than their bacterial relatives and that many organelle processes are known to be driven by nuclear-encoded gene products.
        <p>
          We can summarize and restate this phenomenon using Deacon‚Äôs particular theoretical framework in the following way: during some extended period in the evolution of the eukaryotic cell, the 
          function of energy production for some ancestral cells underwent extrinsic duplication with the presence of, and interaction with, prokaryotic microbes. This permitted selection for 
          certain functional genetic loci in both systems to become relaxed. As a result, explorations of unprecedented modes of interaction could take place, leading to the emergence of higher-level 
          functional synergies and accompanying genomic degregation in both systems. Selection then came to target a system with distributed, relational functionality, now comprised of coupled 
          subunits performing partial functional roles in sustaining a higher-level synergistic composite of what were once independent units. This process became so intensified that the effects of 
          selection eventually stabilized the novel macro-system, generating a much more rigorously consolidated whole whose components now lacked the degree of autonomy they possesed prior to this 
          transformation: a eukaryotic cell with mitochondrial organelles. 
        <p>
          This story of mitochondrial origins also resonates with dynamics familiar to Haff's rules ‚ë§ and ‚ë•, or Performance and Provision. Recall that each rule described, 
          respectively, how some actions of parts must support the functioning of the system to which they belong, and that systems enable such support function behaviour by contributing to 
          the maintenance of a suitable environment for said parts. In other words, for selection to effectively shift from an individual unit to the level of functional 
          synergies between coupled systems‚Äì‚Äìas it is hypothesized to have occured in the hierarchic transition of the eukaryotic cell‚Äì‚Äìwe would expect the behaviour of both organisms to 
          have complemented each other in supporting the higher-level functionality of a now-ubiquitous extant evolutionary unit capable of elevated energy production, despite the subordination
          of certain features of each system to the requirements of the novel global whole. We observe the former, for instance, in the organelle's role in generating metabolic energy for the 
          eukaryotic cell (a function which is also at the foundation of sustaining complex higher animal forms). While the latter can be seen in the constraints on the
          mitochondria's ability to grow and/or reproduce relative to the <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/mitochondria-14053590/">specific energy 
          requirements of specialized eukaryotic cells</a>. Finally, maintenance and 
          persistence of the eukaryotic cell must also be ensured through the provision of resources and/or environments that enable the performance of support functions by its components‚Äì‚Äìas 
          evidenced by the nuclear genome gradually coming to supply resources critical to organelle reproduction and maintenance.
