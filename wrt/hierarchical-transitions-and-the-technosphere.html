     Hierarchical Transitions and the Rules of the Technosphere
  </div>
  <div class="p"><img class="txtimg" src="sphereFolding.jpeg"></p>
  <div class="p">
     Last year I had an opportunity to attend an Environmental Humanities graduate seminar at the University of British Columbia with 
        <a href="https://mcmaster.academia.edu/DerekWoods">Derek Woods</a>. I was unable to register because of a full course load 
        but Derek invited me to sit in during any session I‚Äôd like, if I found the material interesting and relevant to my research. The 
        topic for the class I dropped in on was ‚ÄúPlanetary Technics.‚Äù During the seminar discussions I started contemplating some hazy 
        connections between certain themes in a paper we‚Äôd read about large-scale technological systems (which I‚Äôll introduce in the 
        following section) and some ideas in theoretical biology about the dynamics of collective interaction and major hierarchic 
        transitions. The following text is an attempt to flesh out these conceptual relationships in some more detail. 
     <p>
     This piece is a work in progress. Initially, I‚Äôd only intended to engage with two resources, one text and one lecture, putting them in 
        dialogue with one another to tease out their resemblances and chart future research directions. Naturally, as I was writing I continued 
        to encounter new references that complemented this project and new texts, ideas, and thinkers began to orbit around my efforts. I‚Äôve 
        done my best to integrate some of these new resources into the text, but it‚Äôs definitely far from complete. My hope is that I‚Äôll 
        continue developing this line of thought long after these texts have been shared with you here, especially as it has become increasingly 
        apparent to me that this topic is much richer than I‚Äôd first imagined. Anyways, let me kick things off. 
     <p style="font-size: 30px; padding-bottom: 5px; border-bottom: 1.5px dotted black">Introducing the Technosphere
     <p>
     For Derek‚Äôs seminar that week, the required readings touched on a range of topics related to technology, media, geology, ecology, 
        capitalism, and the¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere">noosphere</a>. Among these publications was
        <a href="https://cee.duke.edu/faculty/peter-haff">Peter Haff</a>‚Äòs¬†<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053019614530575">Humans 
        and Technology in the Anthropocene: Six Rules</a>, a fascinating paper on the quasi-autonomous dynamics of planetary-scale technological systems. 
        In the text, Haff attempts to encapsulate said dynamics using the following six rules:
     <p>
     <p style="margin-left: 30px"> 
        ‚ë† The rule of inaccessibility 
     <br>
        ‚ë° The rule of impotence 
     <br>
        ‚ë¢ The rule of control 
     <br> 
        ‚ë£ The rule of reciprocity 
     <br> 
        ‚ë§ The rule of performance 
     <br>
        ‚ë• The rule of provision 
     </p>
     <p>
     Each of these rules express an important feature of large-scale technological systems which defines how humans are compelled to operate in 
        relation to them. I'm not going to elaborate on each of these rules, so curious readers should pause here and glance at the text 
        (linked above) if they want to be more holistically informed. While there are evidently many possible ways to conceive of something as 
        general as ‚Äúlarge-scale technological systems‚Äù, Haff‚Äôs specific subject of interest is what he calls the <i>technosphere</i>. Let me 
        start off by quickly describing what exactly this means so I can set the stage for the connections I‚Äôm interested in exploring between 
        his work and the idea of hierarchic transitions in biology.
     <p>
     In an academic context, the word ‚Äútechnosphere‚Äù seems to have made its first appearance in a <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1109/MSPEC.1968.5214690">
        1968 text</a> by biomedical engineer and biological control-theory researcher J. H. Milsum, although Haff has certainly made the term his 
        own through a number of publications produced in the last decade or so (e.g. see <a href="www.pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/Haff 2013 Technology as a Geological Phenomenon.pdf">
        1</a> and <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1177/2053019616677743">2</a>), many of which were thematically allied with a growing literature on 
        the Anthropocene. For Haff, the technosphere is said to be the technological analogue to the various natural geological paradigms, or 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_Earth_sciences#Earth's_spheres">planetary spheres</a>, that constitute and sustain the Earth 
        system, such as the geosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, or the biosphere. Haff notes, for instance, that all of the aforementioned 
        systems are global in their extent, autonomous to some degree, and involve the widespread appropriation of resources. These general commonalities
        aside, the technosphere can be understood more specifically as: 
      
     <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        A global interconnected system of 
     </p>
     <p style="margin-left: 50px">
        ‚óè Technical artifacts 
     <br>
        ‚óè Complex social structures
     <br>        
        ‚óè Physical infrastructure 
     </p>
     <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        which characterize
     </p>
     <p style="margin-left: 50px">
        ‚óè The totality of the built human environment
     <br>
        ‚óè The particular energy and resource transformations underpinning the system‚Äôs ‚Äúmetabolic‚Äù profile
     <br>        
        ‚óè The emergent principles that govern our relationship with it. 
     </p>
     <p>
     As evidenced by this definition, the technosphere is not simply the aggregate of all technological objects‚Äì‚Äìmuch like the biosphere is not the 
        mere sum of all planetary biomass‚Äì‚Äìbut rather has dynamic emergent properties that result from the organization of its various components 
        and the associations between them, including constraints, incentives, deterrents, and other relational processes associated with the system‚Äôs 
        functioning. This is to be clearly understood, and I‚Äôll return to this point in a moment. 
     <p>
     We can get a more comprehensive view of what is meant by the technosphere by turning to the following passage from a 2014 text authored by Haff, 
        titled <a href="https://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/Haff 2013 Technology as a Geological Phenomenon.pdf">Technology as a Geological Phenomenon: 
        Implications for Human Well-Being</a>:
     
     <p style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 22px">
     ‚Äú[The technosphere is]‚Ä¶the set of large-scale networked technologies that underlie and make possible rapid extraction from the Earth of large 
        quantities of free energy and subsequent power generation, long distance, nearly instantaneous communication, rapid long-distance energy and 
        mass transport, the existence and operation of modern governmental and other bureaucracies, high-intensity industrial and manufacturing 
        operations including regional, continental and global distribution of food and other goods, and a myriad additional ‚Äòartificial‚Äô or 
        ‚Äònon-natural‚Äô processes without which modern civilization and its present 7 √ó 109 human constituents could not exist. If the term 
        ‚Äòanthroposphere‚Äô is meant to emphasize the role of human beings as causative agents responsible for Earth transformations that define the 
        Anthropocene, the use of ‚Äòtechnosphere‚Äô suggests a more detached view of an emerging geological process that has entrained humans as 
        essential components that support its dynamics.‚Äù  
     </p>
     
     <p>
     This excerpt largely focuses on the many processes enabled by our planetary system of interrelated technological artifacts, while the following quote 
        from a more recent text adds a bit of extra detail regarding the artifactual subsystems which the technosphere comprises, i.e. the various 
        contemporary networked technologies nested within the global system:
            
     <p style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 22px">
     ‚ÄúThe technosphere includes the world‚Äôs large-scale energy and resource extraction systems, power generation and transmission systems, communication,
        transportation, financial and other networks, governments and bureaucracies, cities, factories, farms and myriad other ‚Äòbuilt‚Äô systems, as well
        as all the parts of these systems, including computers, windows, tractors, office memos and humans. It also includes systems which traditionally
        we think of as social or human-dominated, such as religious institutions or NGOs. The Haber-Bosch process and associated technologies, 
        responsible through synthetic fixation of nitrogen and distribution of resulting fertilizers for providing about 40% of the world‚Äôs dietary 
        protein (Smil, 2002), is a specific example of a globally distributed component of the technosphere.‚Äù
     </p>
     
     <p>
     These are, of course, two sides of the same coin‚Äì‚Äìno strict boundaries demarcate components from processes and both are more-or-less continuous and 
        integrated in each of the descriptions above. What‚Äôs important to grasp is the invitation to conceptualize the sheer scale of the technosphere and
        the scope of what this planetary technological system is composed of, or what sort of component systems and processes might be thought to consitute
        its identity. From relatively simple products like office memos and fertilizer, to complex intergenerational socio-cultural forms like religious 
        institutions, cities, and governments, the magnitudinous ambit of the technosphere is vast and totalizing, assimilating nearly all phenomena 
        connected to the workings of contemporary human civilization, including the behaviour of human subjects themselves.
     <p>
     This leads directly to one of the most crucial insights generated by Haff‚Äôs account of large-scale technological networks: i.e. a shift in our 
        thinking away from the ‚Äúnatural assumption that the technosphere is primarily a human-created and controlled system‚Äù and towards ‚Äúthe idea that 
        the workings of modern humanity are a product of a system that operates beyond our control and that imposes its own requirements on human 
        behaviour.‚Äù What could justify a claim like this? One simple idea underlying this view is the relationship between organization and constraint 
        in dynamic systems. I'll expand on this once we get into the biology of hierarchic transitions, but the gist is that in order for a complex 
        dynamic system to persist through time and space, most of the behaviour of its component parts and processes must be consistent with the system‚Äôs 
        functioning. In other words, <i>systemic consistency and robustness requires functional organization, which implies constraints on the degrees 
        of freedom accessible to constituent components</i>. 
     <p>
     Once we're committed to conceiving of the technosphere as as a higher-level unity defined by organizational relations between coupled subsystems, 
        we can begin to see how the interests of human agents, as subordinate elements of the macro-system, must be constrained to some extent so as to 
        align with the properties and/or emergent principles of the complex dynamic system within which they are embedded and whose functioning they are
        reliant upon. Haff's 2014 text supplies us with some examples of what these constraints could be, ranging from "hard" and tangible constraints like 
        architectural and infrastructural barriers, to "soft" and more abstract or normative regulations, such as incentives and/or deterrents for 
        behaviour that supports or interferes with the functioning of a given host system. In an effort to illustrate more broadly the contingent 
        relationship between species survival and a functional technosphere (thereby implying that contemporary human populations are beholden to the 
        organizational constraints of large-scale technological systems) he also advances the following historical speculation: "the pre-Anthropocene, 
        pre-technological ‚Ä¶ human population was perhaps 10 million" and ‚Äúthe ramp-up of technology from pre-history through, e.g., dynastic China, 
        Rome and medieval Europe to today‚Äôs global technology has led to the expansion of this population to a level approaching 10 billion today ‚Ä¶ 
        suggesting that on the order of 999 out of every 1000 humans owe their existence and their wellbeing to technological systems."
     <p>
     In the context of Haff‚Äôs scholarship, the emphasis on this quasi-autonomous property of the technosphere serves as a basis for unconventional 
        investigations into how our networked technological systems, conceived of as a single emerging geological process, interfaces with other 
        Anthropocene-related phenomena in a manner which understates human autonomy over the production and transformations of the built environment. 
        After all, the Anthropocene etymologically denotes a new geological epoch where significant impacts on the planet's climate and ecosystems are 
        the result of the activity of humankind, and therefore part of Haff‚Äôs contribution to that discourse is to invert our assumptions about the 
        directionality of this causal relation. As Haff writes: ‚ÄúThe technosphere is a system for which humans are essential but, nonetheless, 
        subordinate parts ‚Ä¶ This does not mean that humans cannot influence its behavior, but that the technosphere will tend to resist attempts to 
        compromise its function.‚Äù Haff again: ‚Äúhumans have become entrained within the matrix of technology and are now borne along by a supervening 
        dynamics from which they cannot simultaneously escape and survive.‚Äù As we'll see, much of this fundamental insight‚Äì‚Äìthat the emergent dynamics
        of the technosphere restrict and recruit human action to mutually support continued functioning‚Äì‚Äìwill be crucial to building conceptual bridges
        between this novel earth-system paradigm and certain evolutionary principles of biological complexity facilitated by constraint. 
     <p>
     To summarize: 
     <p>
     The technosphere is a composite system and planetary paradigm comparable to other geological phenomena whose components involve 
        everything from biological organisms to technological artifacts, social institutions, and emergent relational processes which both 
        enable and are enabled by the global system, ensuring the reciprocal survival and functioning of both itself and its ‚Äúnatural‚Äù and ‚Äúartificial‚Äù 
        components. As we‚Äôll see, a framework for contemplating the nature of large-scale technological systems such as this might also be put to 
        work in elucidating cognate features of complex biological systems, and vice versa.  
     <p>
     While the entire paper deserves attention, and has likely already been analyzed and developed by others, the remainder of this text will focus 
        solely on Rule 5: Performance, and Rule 6: Provision, drawing comparisons between these principles and some of <a href="https://anthropology.berkeley.edu/terrence-w-deacon">
        Terrence Deacon</a> and <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/dmcshea">Daniel McShea</a>‚Äôs ideas about hierarchic transitions and complexity, 
        evolutionary synergies between coupled systems, and the degradation of lower-level autonomy that accompanies these processes. In order to make
        these connections, and clarify some of the terms I‚Äôve just introduced, I‚Äôm going to turn to some key points from 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWMEnIYEaQQ">a¬†talk</a>¬†that Deacon gave in 2017, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36075549/">
        a paper</a> published in 2022, each pertaining to the subject of hierarchic transitions in biological evolution.
