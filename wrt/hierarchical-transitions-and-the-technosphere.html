               <br>
               Last year I had the opportunity to attend an Environmental Humanities graduate seminar at the University of British Columbia with 
               <a href="https://mcmaster.academia.edu/DerekWoods">Derek Woods</a>. While I was unable to register due to a full course load,
               I dropped in on a single session where the topic of discussion was ‚ÄúPlanetary Technics.‚Äù During the seminar I began contemplating some 
               hazy connections between certain themes relating to a paper we read about large-scale technological systems (which I‚Äôll introduce in the 
               following section) and some ideas in theoretical biology regarding the collective dynamics of major hierarchic 
               transitions. The following text attempts to flesh out these conceptual relationships in more detail. 
            <p>
               This piece is a work in progress. Initially, I only intended to engage with two resources, one text and one lecture, putting them in 
               dialogue with one another to tease out their similarities and chart future research directions. Naturally, as I was writing I encountered
               new references that complemented this project and new texts, ideas, and thinkers began to orbit around my efforts. While far from complete, 
               I‚Äôve done my best to integrate some of these new resources into the following piece. Unlike a polished text with a focused narrative,
               my writing here is an attempt to feel my way through a set of ideas, documenting my thoughts as I piece them together. My hope is that 
               I‚Äôll continue to develop and refine this line of thinking long after this piece has been shared with you here, 
               especially as it has become increasingly apparent that this topic is much richer than I‚Äôd first imagined.

            <p class="subtitle">Introducing the Technosphere
            <p>
               The readings for the seminar that week touched on a range of topics relating to technology, media, geology, ecology, 
               capitalism, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere">noosphere</a>. Among them was 
               <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053019614530575">Humans and Technology in the Anthropocene: Six Rules</a>, a fascinating 
               paper on the quasi-autonomous dynamics of planetary-scale technological systems, authored by Emeritus Professor of Geology and Civil and 
               Environmental Engineering, <a href="https://cee.duke.edu/faculty/peter-haff">Peter Haff</a>. 
               In the text, Haff attempts to encapsulate said dynamics using the following six rules:
            <p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px"> 
               ‚ë† The rule of inaccessibility 
               <br>
               ‚ë° The rule of impotence 
               <br>
               ‚ë¢ The rule of control 
               <br> 
               ‚ë£ The rule of reciprocity 
               <br> 
               ‚ë§ The rule of performance 
               <br>
               ‚ë• The rule of provision 
            </p>
            <p>
               Each of these rules is meant to express an important feature of large-scale, hierarchically-nested or stratified technological systems 
               while also defining how humans are compelled to operate in relation to them. Those looking for a more comprehensive account of these rules 
               are encouraged to consult the entire paper (linked above) as this piece will not discuss them in great detail. In a nutshell, however, 
               they can be summarized by the following:
            <p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px"> 
               ‚ë† Inaccessibility: Differences in size or scale of two or more systems strongly limits precise interactions between their local variables.
               <br>
               ‚ë° Impotence: Larger scale systems constrain lower-tier components and are therefore generally unresponsive to most behavior of these nested 
               subsystems.
               <br>
               ‚ë¢ Control: No individual part may directly control or cause a system's behaviour but can act in such a way to more effectively enable the 
               system to maintain viability.
               <br> 
               ‚ë£ Reciprocity: Symmetrical interactions between two or more systems are limited to those sharing the same stratum or scale. 
               <br> 
               ‚ë§ Performance: Some actions of most system parts are compelled to support the function of the system to which they belong. 
               <br>
               ‚ë• Provision: Higher-stratum systems contribute to the maintenance of a suitable environment for their components so as to enable their support 
               function behaviour. 
            </p>
            <p>  
               Now, there are evidently many ways to interpret something as broad as a planetary-scale or large-scale technological system. Comparable 
               forms of this general idea‚Äì‚Äìi.e. a global sphere produced by and consisting of aspects of human reason, scientific knowledge, and technological 
               development‚Äì‚Äìhave been explored before through concepts like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthroposphere">Anthroposphere</a>, 
               <a href="https://www.sociostudies.org/almanac/articles/conceptions_of_a_global_brain_an_historical_review/">Metaman, Conscious-Technology, 
               The Global Brain</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere">Noosphere</a>. 
               Haff‚Äôs specific formulation of this idea is what he calls the <i>technosphere</i>. I'll begin with some descriptions of this term to set the 
               stage for the connections I‚Äôm interested in exploring between Haff's work and the idea of hierarchic transitions in biology.
            <p>
               In an academic context, the word ‚Äútechnosphere‚Äù can be traced back to a <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1109/MSPEC.1968.5214690">
               1968 text</a> by biomedical engineer and biological control-theory researcher J. H. Milsum, although Haff has made the term his 
               own through a number of publications in the last decade or so (e.g. see 
               <a href="www.pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/Haff 2013 Technology as a Geological Phenomenon.pdf">
               1</a> and <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1177/2053019616677743">2</a>), many of which were thematically allied with a growing literature on 
               the Anthropocene. For Haff, the technosphere is said to be the technological analogue to the various natural geological paradigms or 
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_Earth_sciences#Earth's_spheres">planetary spheres</a> that constitute and sustain the Earth 
               system, such as the geosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, or the biosphere. Haff notes, for instance, that all of the aforementioned 
               systems are global in their extent, autonomous to some degree, and involve the widespread appropriation of resources. General commonalities
               aside, a more specific albeit contracted description of the technosphere is as follows:
            <p style="margin-left: 30px">
               A global interconnected system of 
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px">
               ‚óæ Technical artifacts 
               <br>
               ‚óæ Social structures
               <br>        
               ‚óæ Physical infrastructure 
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px">
               which constitute
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px">
               ‚óæ The totality of the built human environment
               <br>
               ‚óæ The particular energy and resource transformations underpinning the system‚Äôs ‚Äúmetabolic‚Äù profile
               <br>        
               ‚óæ The emergent principles that govern our relationship with it. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Per this definition, the technosphere is not simply the aggregate of all technological objects‚Äì‚Äìmuch like the biosphere is not the 
               mere sum of all planetary biomass‚Äì‚Äìbut rather has dynamic emergent properties that result from the organization of its various components 
               and the associations between them, including constraints, incentives, deterrents, and other relational processes associated with the system‚Äôs 
               functioning. This central characterization of a complex system such as the technosphere or the biosphere is to be clearly understood and 
               we‚Äôll return to this point in a moment. 
            <p>
               We can get a richer, more extensive view of what is meant by the technosphere in Haff's own words in the following passage taken from a 2014 text 
               titled <a href="https://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/Haff 2013 Technology as a Geological Phenomenon.pdf">Technology as a Geological Phenomenon: 
               Implications for Human Well-Being</a>:
            <p class="quote">
               ‚Äú[The technosphere is]‚Ä¶the set of large-scale networked technologies that underlie and make possible rapid extraction from the Earth of large 
               quantities of free energy and subsequent power generation, long distance, nearly instantaneous communication, rapid long-distance energy and 
               mass transport, the existence and operation of modern governmental and other bureaucracies, high-intensity industrial and manufacturing 
               operations including regional, continental and global distribution of food and other goods, and a myriad additional ‚Äòartificial‚Äô or 
               ‚Äònon-natural‚Äô processes without which modern civilization and its present 7 √ó 109 human constituents could not exist. If the term 
               ‚Äòanthroposphere‚Äô is meant to emphasize the role of human beings as causative agents responsible for Earth transformations that define the 
               Anthropocene, the use of ‚Äòtechnosphere‚Äô suggests a more detached view of an emerging geological process that has entrained humans as 
               essential components that support its dynamics.‚Äù  
            </p>
            <p>
               Haff once more, from the more recent article which we read in the seminar: 
            <p class="quote">
               ‚ÄúThe technosphere includes the world‚Äôs large-scale energy and resource extraction systems, power generation and transmission systems, communication,
               transportation, financial and other networks, governments and bureaucracies, cities, factories, farms and myriad other ‚Äòbuilt‚Äô systems, as well
               as all the parts of these systems, including computers, windows, tractors, office memos and humans. It also includes systems which traditionally
               we think of as social or human-dominated, such as religious institutions or NGOs. The Haber-Bosch process and associated technologies, 
               responsible through synthetic fixation of nitrogen and distribution of resulting fertilizers for providing about 40% of the world‚Äôs dietary 
               protein (Smil, 2002), is a specific example of a globally distributed component of the technosphere.‚Äù
            </p>
            <p>
               These excerpts highlight the many energetic, informational, productional, and logistical processes enabled by our planetary technological system
               as well as some concrete examples of the interrelated artifactual 
               subsystems which the technosphere comprises, i.e. the various contemporary networked technologies nested within the global system. Both these 
               aspects (built artifactual systems and the myriad dynamic processes they facilitate) are part and parcel of the descriptions above and draw our 
               attention to the sheer scale and scope of the technosphere, its constituent processes, and component subsystems. From relatively 
               simple products like office memos and fertilizer, to complex intergenerational
               socio-cultural forms like religious institutions, cities, and governments, the magnitude of the technosphere is vast and totalizing, assimilating 
               nearly all phenomena connected to the workings of contemporary human civilization, including the behaviour of human subjects themselves.
            <p>
               This leads us directly to one of the central aspects of Haff‚Äôs theory of large-scale technological networks: his insistence on a shift in our 
               thinking away from the ‚Äúnatural assumption that the technosphere is primarily a human-created and controlled system‚Äù and towards ‚Äúthe idea that 
               the workings of modern humanity are a product of a system that operates beyond our control and that imposes its own requirements on human 
               behaviour.‚Äù Put more plainly: "...humans are components of a larger sphere they did not design, do not understand, do not control and from which 
               they cannot escape.." Haff notes that similar positions have been articulated before in other scholarly contexts, particularly by political 
               and social theorists such as <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262730495/autonomous-technology/">Langdon Winner</a> and 
               <a href="https://ia803209.us.archive.org/2/items/JacquesEllulTheTechnologicalSociety/Jacques%20Ellul%20-%20The%20Technological%20Society.pdf">
               Jacques Ellul</a>, who have written about the emergence of modern autonomous technological systems and 
               "whose works go a long way toward disabusing the notion that humans operate as independent agents in the modern technological world."  
            <p>  
               One way of thinking about this relationship between human agents and the technosphere is to frame it in terms of how the properties of 
               <i>organization</i> and <i>constraint</i> operate in complex systems. Haff devotes a section to these ideas, which I will expand on in more 
               detail once we get into the biology of hierarchic transitions. For now it will suffice to say that the general idea is that for a complex 
               dynamic system to persist through time and space, that is, to maintain some systemic coherent unity at a relevant temporal and spatial scale,  
               most of its component parts and processes must behave, and be organized in relation to one another, in a manner that is consistent with 
               the system‚Äôs ability to reproduce itself as a unity. In other words, <i>systemic consistency and robustness requires functional organization, 
               implying constraints on the degrees of freedom accessible to constituent components</i>. 
            <p>
               Once we're committed to conceiving of the technosphere as a higher-level unity defined by organizational relations between coupled subsystems, 
               we can begin to see how human agents function as subordinate elements whose interests must be constrained to some extent to 
               align with the properties and/or emergent principles of the complex dynamic system within which they are embedded. Haff's 
               <a hef="https://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/Haff%202013%20Technology%20as%20a%20Geological%20Phenomenon.pdf">2014 text</a> supplies us
               with some examples of what these constraints could be, ranging from "hard" and tangible constraints like 
               architectural and infrastructural barriers, to "soft" and more normative or abstract directives, such as instituional statutes, and incentives or 
               deterrents for 
               behaviour that supports or interferes with the functioning of a given host system. Taken together, these features of the technosphere can be 
               viewed as expressions of the first 4 rules: planetary scale, distributed systemic functionality (‚ë¢ control) and organizational constraint (‚ë° 
               impotence) inhibits direct causal interactions between different strata (‚ë† inaccessibility) of a large, complex, dynamic technological system, 
               and such a system may only be affected by other systems which inhabit comparable scales and are capable therefore of mutual interaction (‚ë£ 
               reciprocity).     
            <p>   
               Importantly, the intertwining of humans and the technosphere also means that we are increasingly reliant upon its functioning to support our 
               well-being and continuation as a species. For instance, Haff puts forth the following estimation to really drive home the extent to which 
               contemporary human populations are beholden to the organizational constraints, and affordances, of large-scale 
               technological systems: "the pre-Anthropocene, pre-technological ‚Ä¶ human population was perhaps 10 million"
               and "the ramp-up of technology from pre-history through, e.g., dynastic China, Rome and medieval Europe to today‚Äôs global technology has led to 
               the expansion of this population to a level approaching 10 billion today ‚Ä¶ suggesting that on the order of 999 out of every 1000 humans owe their 
               existence and their wellbeing to technological systems." 
            <p>
               Conceived of as an emerging geological process, Haff's emphasis on the quasi-autonomous property of the technosphere frames
               how our networked technological systems relate to other Anthropocene-related phenomena in a manner which strongly understates human autonomy over 
               the production and transformation of the built environment. 
               After all, the Anthropocene denotes a geological epoch where significant impacts on the planet's climate and ecosystems are 
               the result of the activity of humankind, and therefore part of the uniqueness of Haff‚Äôs contribution to such discourse is to unsettle our 
               assumptions about this causal relation. As Haff writes: "The technosphere is a system for which humans are essential but, nonetheless, 
               subordinate parts ‚Ä¶ This does not mean that humans cannot influence its behavior, but that the technosphere will tend to resist attempts to 
               compromise its function." Haff again: "humans have become entrained within the matrix of technology and are now borne along by a supervening 
               dynamics from which they cannot simultaneously escape and survive." 
            <p> 
               As we'll see, it is my view that in addition to Haff's contribution to discourse regarding technology and the Anthropocene, the general framework 
               of this perspective‚Äì‚Äìthat the emergent dynamics of the technosphere restrict and recruit human action to mutually support continued functioning 
               of the resultant macrosystem‚Äì‚Äìresonates with certain theories concerning evolutionary principles of biological complexity facilitated by 
               hierarchical constraint. Elaborating on this similarity may provide some interesting insights into the principles of both biological complexity 
               and our novel planetary-scale paradigm.  
            <p>
               To summarize: the technosphere is a composite system and planetary paradigm comparable to other geological phenomena. Its components include 
               everything from biological organisms to technological artifacts, social institutions, and emergent relational processes which both 
               enable and are enabled by the global system. These organizational constraints play a significant role in ensuring the reciprocal survival and 
               functioning of both the whole system and its natural and artificial components. Conceptualizing the nature of large-scale technological systems 
               in the aforementioned manner might also illuminate equivalences 
               between the dynamics of the emerging technosphere and certain hierarchically-nested biological systems.   
            <p>
               The remainder of this text will focus on drawing comparisons between these principles, some of Haff's rules, and the ideas of 
               <a href="https://anthropology.berkeley.edu/terrence-w-deacon">
               Terrence Deacon</a> and <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/dmcshea">Daniel McShea</a> regarding hierarchic
               transitions in coupled systems and the transformations in complexity and autonomy that accompany such processes. In order to make
               these connections, and clarify some of the terms I‚Äôve just introduced, I turn to some key points from 
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWMEnIYEaQQ">a talk</a> that Deacon gave in 2017, as well as

            <p class="subtitle">Hierarchical Transitions
            <p>
               A couple of years ago I came across a presentation on YouTube titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWMEnIYEaQQ">"Hierarchic Transitions 
               in Evolution"</a>, delivered by neuroanthropoligist <a href="https://anthropology.berkeley.edu/terrence-w-deacon">Terrence Deacon</a> 
               for a virtual seminar series associated with Binghampton University‚Äôs 
               <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/evos/">Evolutionary Studies Program</a>. I've also discovered more recently that the ideas Deacon covered in 
               this talk have also been articulated in a 2022 article in the journal Biosystems titled <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36075549/">A 
               Degenerative Process Underlying Hierarchic Transitions in Evolution</a>. In both these resources, Deacon speculates on how the hierarchic 
               complexity of organismal structure, function, and form are generated through evolutionary processes. Generally speaking, <i>transitions in 
               hierarchic complexity</i> refers to a biological phenomenon whereby numerous autonomous living entities develop co-dependent or synergistic 
               behaviours with the collective relations of an emergent system, sometimes comprised of two or more coupled systems, often leading to the 
               stabilization of new macro-scale biological units (such as pluricellular or multicellular organisms). Hierarchic complexity also denotes what 
               some believe to be a resultant decrease in the functional autonomy of the novel system's constituent entities that occupy lower-tier strata 
               relative to the emergent global whole. Owing in part to the lack of any widely accepted theory of how such transformations in hierarchic 
               complexity occur, Deacon has developed his own framework for thinking about how these organizational and morphological features of living 
               systems emerge at various scales, and how this process might be implicated in 
               <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-major-transitions-in-evolution-9780198502944">
               evolutionary developments such as transitions in individuality</a>. Much like Haff's work on the technosphere, Deacon's theory of hierarchic 
               complexity reflects a similar concern for principles of organization and constraint, distributed functionality, and gradations of 
               autonomy across multiple scales of complex hierarchically-structured systems.  
            <p>
               Deacon's thoughts on this topic are contributions to an existing body of modern literature on the phenomenon of hierarchical transitions, 
               or evolutionary transitions in individuality, that is nearly a century and a half old. As mentioned above, this is a process by which 
               groups of discrete organisms collectively form higher-level aggregate entities or novel concrete biological individuals. In this context, 
               a biological entity or individual refers to: <i>a temporally-enduring spatially-individuated being with properties or 
               functions such as feeding, reproduction, and self-preservation that belong to the system at the highest-level</i>. A broad range of examples can 
               be used to illustrate this idea, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiogenesis">origin of eukaryotic cells via prokaryotic 
               symbiosis</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism#Origin_hypotheses">multicellular entities arising from unicellular 
               organisms</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superorganism">colonies formed from pluricellular individuals</a>. An early treatment 
               of this topic in the modern history of biology can be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a>'s 
               19th c. works <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54612">Principles of Biology</a> and 
               <a href="https://praxeology.net/HS-SP.htm#firstprinciples">First Principles</a>, which theorized, in the parlance of their time, about the 
               nature of hierarchically-nested scales of biological organization. In 1942, a series of papers published together under the title 
               <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/aesa/36.1.142">Biological Symposia, Vol VIII.

               the origins of multicellularity, and comparisons of human and insect societies. Throughout the latter half of the 20th c., major contributions

               as well that this text only engages with a minute sampling of available resources on this topic.    
            <p>
               In his lecture, Deacon first sets out to address what he sees as a contradiction in ‚Äúreplicator-selection stories‚Äù of evolution, i.e. explanations 
               of evolutionary phenomena most commonly associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene">selfish gene theory</a>. Deacon 
               posits that replicator-selection theories mistakenly overemphasize absolute autonomy and controlled replication as the primary and conserved 
               features underpinning evolving biological systems, instantiated in what is thought to be the most fundamental causal unit of the organism: the 
               genetic components of individual cells. Deacon reasons, however, that the existence of evolving hierarchically-complex living systems implies 
               coordination and regulation across a multitude of intraorganismal and extra-cellular spatial and temporal scales, and that the autonomy of the 
               constituents of such systems, and the degree of control they can exercise, must therefore be relinquished to some degree if synergies between 
               these various interdependent levels are to develop at all. In his most recent paper, Deacon substantiates this point by drawing from a 2017 
               article titled <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519316304349">On the Developmental Self-Regulatory Dynamics 
               and Evolution of Individuated Multicellular Organisms</a>, written by theoretical biologist Felipe Veloso, who Deacon believes ‚Äúunambiguously 
               demonstrates that the development of multicellular animals depends on a shift of control from intracellular genetic constraints to 
               extra-cellular relational constraints that emerge at the organism level.‚Äù
            <p>
               To further develop this perspective, Deacon turns to the important work of evolutionary biologist 
               <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/our-authors/buss-leo-w">Leo Buss</a>, and the phenomena of 
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism">multicellular individuality</a> in plants, animals, and fungi, to provide examples 
               of a class of systems which favour sophisticated cooperation and exhibit autonomy-limiting properties at various scales of their organization. 
               For instance, Deacon describes how fungi enable cellular cooperation via cell membranes which are porous enough to favor widespread homogeneity 
               in cell-type and tissues. The logic here is that having cell membranes with greater permeability makes it difficult to correlate the influence 
               of a set of genes, or a genome, with controlled effects in the immediate surroundings of its local nucleus, rather than that of neighbouring 
               cells. In other words, if the membrane cannot reliably regulate what enters and leaves the cell, gene products can have effects both inside and 
               outside the cell in an untargeted manner, nullifying any strong demarcation between one cell and any other. As a result, from any 
               individual cell's point of view, it is unfeasible to guarantee whether their genes will be the ones reproduced in the fruiting body. 
               Cooperative reproductive behaviour among cells may then emerge as a compensatory mechanism for this constraint on the absolute reproductive 
               autonomy of any given cell in the collective. In the case of plants, Deacon points to the structural limitations of rigid cell walls and their 
               role in restricting movement and fostering highly deterministic cell fates. This is a more coercive evolutionary strategy than that of fungal 
               organisms, but nonetheless facilitates systemic cohesion while dampening cellular autonomy. Briefly put: multicellular synergistic cooperation 
               among cellular components ‚Äúis accomplished in fungi by preventing genetic determination of distinct tissue types, in plants by eliminating 
               mobility of cells, and in animals by determination of cell lineage fates by maternal factors prior to cell-specific gene expression.‚Äù In all cases, 
               multicellular eukaryotic systems are thought to have achieved stabilized individuation in part by preventing any given cell from fully 
               and independently determining whether it can replicate or persist alone. Without this constraint, the integrity of the global system is likely 
               to be compromised by selfish unfettered replication, such as that which occurs during cancerous cell growth. 
            <p>
               Here we return to the description I began to sketch in the previous section about organization and constraint in dynamic systems. Both Haff and 
               Deacon‚Äì‚Äìas well as many of those working on the question of hierarchic transitions more generally‚Äì‚Äìare tapping into a very similar framework 
               for thinking about related phenomena in both biological and social reality. Much like the dynamics of multicellularity, the technosphere and 
               its dynamics can be viewed as a hierarchical system that exploits similar principles of constraint in its organizational constitution to ensure 
               the reciprocal and synergistic functioning of an emergent global whole relative to its parts, irrespective of the material basis of the 
               components. One principal difference, however, between Haff and Deacon is that the former focuses mostly on an analysis of how a hybrid 
               techno-bio-social system such as this might <i>work</i>, while the latter is providing a theory for how similarly structured biological 
               systems <i>got to be this way</i>.
            <p>
               Deacon's question, then, is ultimately an evolutionary, or perhaps historical, one: i.e. <i>how, then, might any form of synergistic cooperation 
               underpinning hierarchically-organized biological systems, and the implicit constraints on autonomy that result from such organization, occur 
               in the first place?</i> Deacon attempts to address this with the following proposal: 
            <p style="margin-left: 30px">
               ‚óæ In biology, environmental changes, as well as certain intra-organismal dynamics, can alter the selection pressures maintaining a particular trait. 
               When the efficacy of a source of selection is weakened or eliminated entirely this is termed <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/j.tree.2009.03.010">
               "relaxed selection"</a> and can lead to the reduction or loss of traits and/or functions. In some cases, however, it can instigate biological novelty.
               <br>
               ‚óæ Building on the latter of these two outcomes, Deacon speculates that if selection is relaxed on some functional trait of a system or 
               entity (let's say system or entity 'A'), this opens a space of possibility, outside the scope of selection pressures, for random explorations
               of unprecedented interactions between 'A' and other, often molecular, system or entity ('B').
               <br> 
               ‚óæ Should advantageous functionality emerge as a result of 'A' and 'B's interactivity, selection pressure can now shift to target the synergistic
               composite of 'A', 'B' and their relationality, amplifying their mutual dependency.
               <br> 
               ‚óæ As this relationship develops, adaptively valuable functions once carried out independently by 'A' and/or 'B' may now become transformed, or distributed 
               across the interactions of the emergent coupled system, becoming increasingly constituted and selected for at this higher level of organization involving how 'A' 
               and 'B' interact synergistically. 
               <br> 
               ‚óæ Furthermore, as this coupling is strengthened through selection over evolutionary time, 'A' and/or 'B' will progressively assume the functional 
               role of a component in the context of the larger novel macro-system. 
            </p>
            Importantly, Deacon submits that this new hierarchically-organized system with synergistic,
            distributed functionality is only sustainable if its development ensures that the loss of autonomy occurring at the lower levels of the constituent 
            parts is also beneficial for said components, and that this benefit is sufficient to sustain the integrant subsystems' ability to perform 
            support functions and contribute to the persistence and maintenance of higher-level functionality and macro-systemic or global order. This point will 
            be especially salient as we dive into Haff's rules ‚ë§ and ‚ë• in later sections. In the meantime, my hope is that the reader has begun to see an image taking shape of 
            the conceptual resemblances between Haff and Deacon's perspectives, each an analysis of emergent hierarchically-organized systems where control and 
            functionality are distributed across the collective relations of components whose existence and autonomy has become subordinated to, and 
            dependent on, global identity and constraint.       
            <p>
               To contrast with the slightly more abstract theorization in the previous paragraphs, the following sections turn to some specific examples 
               of relaxed selection and hierarchical transitions which Deacon uses to clarify and support this theory.

            <p class="subtitle">Intrinsic Duplication + Ancestral Haemoglobin
            <p>
               To build his case, Deacon must establish an explanation of the scale-invariant continuity of this process of relaxed selection and hierarchic 
               complexity, beginning at the molecular, or <i>intrinsic</i> scale, and moving towards the <i>extrinsic</i> scale of intercellular and 
               extra-organismal dynamics. A representative case of one circumstance known to facilitate relaxed selection at the molecular scale is 
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_duplication">gene duplication</a> 
               or polyploidy, wherein <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/j.tree.2009.03.010">"genes or genomes replicate such that selection can act on one copy 
               but is relaxed on the other.</a>" Gene duplication has been 
               hypothesized to play an important role in the evolution of biological novelty via the generation of redundant loci which become free to explore 
               non-deleterious transformations in phenotypic structure and/or functions‚Äì‚Äìa ‚Äúrandom walk‚Äù away from the original function‚Äì‚Äìwhile a duplicate gene 
               continues to perform essential ancestral tasks. Deacon speaks to this process in greater detail in his 2022 Biosystems article: 
            <p class="quote">
               "[non-deleterious point mutations in a gene duplicate] may result in a progressive loss of the specificity of protein function, with some functional 
               associations being lost while other related interactions 
               maintained. Whereas the initial evolution of protein function may involve structural compromises to accommodate its multiple associations to other 
               molecules, multiple variant forms may provide a ‚Äúhave your cake and eat it too‚Äù option, with each variant form able to evolve greater specificity for 
               one or another of these sub-functional capacities. In other words, the duplication, relaxation of selection, and random walk can provide a kind of 
               exploration of the space of possible synergistic relationships that lie, in effect, in the ‚Äúfunction space‚Äù just adjacent to an existing function. This 
               is a recipe for increasing functional complexity."
            </p>
            <p>
               In Deacon's view, the underlying principles shaping this process of intrinsic duplication, relaxed selection, and random walk, and the exploration
               of possible synergistic relations in a novel function space that it engenders, can be generalized and expanded to encompass analogous processes
               occurring extrinsic to biological entities as well. That is to say, while intrinsic duplication operates at genetic, 
               molecular, and regulatory levels, Deacon conjectures that extrinsic duplication can also occur at organismal and social scales. 
               This will be key to understanding the links between Deacon's theoretical considerations and hierarchical constraint in planetary technological systems. 
               In his lecture, Deacon provides numerous examples of intrinsic duplication involving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/aWMEnIYEaQQ?feature=share&t=1475">

            <p>
               In the case of the globin gene family, Deacon discusses how selection may have become relaxed for duplicate descendants of an ancestral haemoglobin
               gene, allowing mutations to accrue in less evolutionarily-conserved structural elements (as opposed to, say, genes associated with the shape of the 
               oxygen-binding element). Over time, certain structural variations in ancestral haemoglobin populations afforded the possibility for a synergistic 
               complementarity between variants to arise, such that two novel molecular structures (Œ± and Œ≤ haemoglobin) eventually found themselves capable 
               of binding with one another, producing a tetramer capable of carrying not one but four iron atoms, enabling superior oxygen transportation 
               throughout the vascular system. 
            <p>  
               In this prototypical example of a hierarchic transition via intrinsic duplication, "the alpha and beta hemoglobin duplicates each acquired independent 
               changes in shape but minimal changes in oxygen binding capacity in their separate divergence from the original ‚Äúancestral‚Äù hemoglobin gene. Changes 
               that increased the stability of tetrameric binding appear to have been favored by natural selection with respect to one another, probably because of 
               the superior oxygen transport capacity of the tetrahedral form." In other words, as relaxed selection facilitated sampling for combinations of the 
               two systems (interactive structural coupling of alpha and beta haemoglobin), this in turn could enable selection to target and stabilize a 
               synergistic, higher-level function (amplified oxygen transportation), distributed globally across a new coupled system (haemoglobin tetramer).

            <p class="subtitle">Extrinsic Duplication + Hierarchic Biological Complexity
            <p>
               Deacon‚Äôs notion of hierarchic complexity via extrinsic duplication finally brings us outside the intracellular realm of molecular variation and 
               structural coupling into a domain of complex coupled interactions between organisms and/or environmental changes, while bridging both. In both resources 
               referenced in this text, Deacon provides a number of examples to flesh out his notion of extrinsic duplication, including 
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiogenesis">endosymbiosis</a>, 
               <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/science/vitamins-old-old-edge.html">exogenous Vitamin C intake and a loss of function of the GULO gene</a>, 
               the emergence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusociality">eusocial collectives</a> and the diminished 
               autonomy of its members, and the development of language in humans and song structure in finches. Unlike intrinsic duplication, which often 
               involves genetic, structural, or segmental duplications internal to the biological system, many of these cases involve interactions between an organism 
               and an external and duplicate source of an intrinsic function. Quoting Deacon at length in his discussion of the transition from the endogenous metabolic 
               synthesis of ascorbic acid to exogenous dietary dependency in anthropoid primates: 
            <p class="quote">
               "...reduced selection on the intrinsic function that is thereby provided with redundant support from 
               outside will allow the intrinsic capacity to degrade..." and "...selection can be redistributed fractionally across highly diverse, and previously independent, 
               genetic loci and epigenetic mechanisms. ...extrinsic ascorbic acid dependency provides us with an opportunity to look at some of the secondary consequences of 
               this degradation. The reduction of purifying selection maintaining this enzyme in turn would have unmasked selection on a variety of other traits that help 
               guarantee the availability of this now essential nutrient. Thus, the behavioral flexibility that initially allowed primates to regularly forage on fruit 
               eventually ‚Äúaddicted‚Äù anthropoid primates to a dietary niche in which fruit acquisition and digestion were critical. Degradation of this gene and its function 
               would have unmasked selection on many diverse traits that coincidentally supported this ‚Äúaddiction.‚Äù These likely included the capacity to judge the ripeness 
               of fruit (e.g., by the evolution of three-color vision), forage on the outer limbs of trees (e.g. by arboreal locomotor adaptations), find the sugar-rich and 
               slightly acidic content of fruit attractive (e.g. taste receptor changes), and metabolize the sugars and tolerate the ethanol that over-ripe fruits contain 
               (e.g. by changes in liver enzymes). All of these could be considered part of an adaptive suite for guaranteeing the supply of ascorbic acid."
            </p>
            In other words, if relaxed selection takes place for ancestral, primarily genetic loci whose associated function has now been 
            externally replicated by a suite of inter-organismal or environmental relations, the mechanisms underpinning this function can diversify and become distributed 
            across a broader synergistic aggregate of genetic, epigenetic, behavioural, and/or environmental systems and relations. Furthermore, this adaptive suite of coupled
            subsystems supplies a target for selection to act upon, facilitating stabilizing effects at the higher level of the whole novel emergent system. 
            <p>
               The figure below depicts a oversimplified schematic of this phenomenon, whereby a gene or set of genes (Gene(s) 4) that once corresponded 
               directly to a phenotype (Function 4) will degrade as a result of relaxed selection owing to the presence of an external, duplicate function (Environmental Duplication). 
               Selective pressures are now distributed across any and all loci (Function 1, Function 5, Function 1B, Function 5B) with operational roles sustaining the exogenous source 
               for the target function. 
               <br>
               <img class="txtimg" src="edDiagram.jpeg">
               Once again, we end up with the emergence and stabilization of a new synergistically-constituted systemic order whose viability is maintained through organizational 
               constraints on the autonomy or functional independence of the elements that comprise this new adaptive suite of relations. Notably, these elements are not confined
               to the interior of a biological system, like a cell, but involve coupling of intra-organismal and environmental or exo-organismal variables. These assorted 
               elements‚Äì‚Äìfrom molecular to organismal behaviour, exogenous effects, and relations with an environment or between living systems‚Äì‚Äìhave now been effectively recruited 
               as component parts providing support functions for a higher-level hierarchical system. From the perspective of the macrosystem enabled by this transition in hierarchic 
               complexity, these elements are, in some sense, what Haff might call ‚Äúessential but, nonetheless, subordinate parts.‚Äù    
            <p>  
               The general application of this principle to major hierarchic transitions in biological evolution, or as Deacon puts it, the identification of a "generic 
               sequence of phases in the evolutionary process..." which describe "a trajectory that is common to ... major biological transitions", brings us 
               to two much-discussed phenomena in the literature of theoretical biology: endosymbiosis and multicellularity. These examples sharply highlight 
               the constraints on autonomy experienced by subordinate parts as a result of their integration into an emergent system through the process of hierarchical transition, and 
               provide a clearer sense of the implications this understanding might have for interpreting the ongoing development of the technosphere.

               Obligate endosymbionts, particularly mitochondria, are ideal systems for thinking through the similarities between Haff‚Äôs rules and Deacon‚Äôs hierarchic complexity. There is
               an extensive literature on the evolution of mitochondria, the organelles that synthesize ATP (the so-called ‚Äòenergy currency of the cell‚Äô) which powers a myriad 
               of biochemical and physiological processes in nearly all eurakyrotic organisms. However, for our purposes, I will provide only a truncated description of what is known as mitochondrial 
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiogenesis">symbiogenesis</a> or the <i>endosymbiotic theory of origin</i>. According to this theory‚Äì‚Äìpopularized and substantiated by 
               evolutionary biologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Margulis">Lynn Margulis</a> following a resurgence in the idea of symbiogenesis in the 1960s‚Äì‚Äìorganelles in 
               eukaryotic cells, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, were once free-living microbes which developed obligate endosymbiotic relationships 
               with proto-eukaryotic host-cells. In other words, one set of once-independent organisms were engulfed by another, and each came to depend on the other for their survival. 
               As the energy-producing properties of these microbes became increasingly valuable to the functioning of the host cell they became progressively assimilated into the 
               whole proto-eukaryotic cellular system. Over evolutionary time, these micro-organisms are thought to have transitioned from autonomous living entities to 
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiont">endosymbionts</a>, and finally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle">organelles</a>.
               Some explanations of this evolutionary development have included: 
            <p style="margin-left: 30px"> 
               ‚óæ The advantage conferred by possessing multiple energy producing units within a single cell
               <br>
               ‚óæ Genomic degradation of both ancestral subsystems of the eukaryotic cell 
               <br>
               ‚óæ A considerable loss of autonomy at the level of the former prokaryote 
               <br>
               ‚óæ The increasingly synergetic, distributed functionality of the new unified macro-system. 
            <p>
               Deacon highlights some of these features in his presentation and paper, noting <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2014.0330">estimates</a> "that mitochondria have 
               lost as much as 99% of the functional genes typically present in their bacterial ancestors" with many of these genes being transposed to the nuclear genome as a result of the transition. 
               A significant portion of proteins critical to organelle functioning are now produced by nuclear genes, while some nuclear genes have degraded as a result of organelles performing certain metabolic 
               functions for the cell. Deacon is certainly not the only person to articulate to this. In fact, it is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg1271">relatively well understood</a> 
               that the mitochondrial genome is dramatically smaller than their bacterial relatives and that many organelle processes are known to be driven by nuclear-encoded gene products.
            <p>
               We can summarize and restate this phenomenon using Deacon‚Äôs particular theoretical framework in the following way: during some extended period in the evolution of the eukaryotic cell, the 
               function of energy production for some ancestral cells underwent extrinsic duplication with the presence of, and interaction with, prokaryotic microbes. This permitted selection for 
               certain functional genetic loci in both systems to become relaxed. As a result, explorations of unprecedented modes of interaction could take place, leading to the emergence of higher-level 
               functional synergies and accompanying genomic degradation in both systems. Selection then came to target a system with distributed, relational functionality, now comprised of coupled 
               subunits performing partial functional roles in sustaining a higher-level synergistic composite of what were once independent units. This process became so intensified that the effects of 
               selection eventually stabilized the novel macro-system, generating a much more rigorously consolidated whole (a eukaryotic cell with organelles) whose components now lacked the degrees of 
               autonomy they once possessed (first as free-living organisms and then as endosymbionts) prior to this transformation. In his 2022 paper, Deacon makes a comparison 
               between endosymbiosis in the evolution of the eukaryotic cell and exogenous Vitamin C intake and the degradation of intrinsic biosynthesis in primates, suggesting that both examples "involve 
               the degradation and reorganizational effects that characterize extrinsic duplication of function" where "redundancy of molecular functions previously provided by the host genome ... 
               begins as an extrinsic duplication of functions regulated by [a] previously autonomous genome."
            <p>
            This story of mitochondrial origins also resonates with dynamics familiar to Haff's rules ‚ë§ and ‚ë•, or Performance and Provision. Recall that each rule 
            described, respectively, how some actions of parts must support the functioning of the system to which they belong, and that systems enable such support 
            function behaviour by contributing to the maintenance of a suitable environment for said parts. These two rules give us additional points of reference 
            for reasoning about the following: for selection to effectively shift from an individual unit to the level of functional synergies between coupled 
            systems‚Äì‚Äìas it is hypothesized to have occured in the hierarchic transition of the eukaryotic cell‚Äì‚Äìwe would expect the behaviour of both organisms 
            to have complemented each other in supporting the higher-level functionality of a now-ubiquitous extant evolutionary unit capable of elevated energy 
            production, despite the subordination of certain features of each system to the requirements of the novel global whole. We observe the former, for instance, 
            in the organelle's role in generating metabolic energy for the eukaryotic cell (an instrumental property in the generation of complex higher animal forms), 
            as well as in the degradation of certain nuclear genetic functionality owing to the metabolic tasks performed by organelles. The latter may be seen operating 
            through constraints on the mitochondria's ability to grow and/or reproduce relative to the 
            <a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/mitochondria-14053590/">specific energy requirements of specialized eukaryotic cells</a>. Finally, 
            maintenance and persistence of the eukaryotic cell is also ensured through the provision of resources and/or environments that enable the performance 
            of support functions by its components, as evidenced by the nuclear genome gradually coming to supply resources critical to organelle reproduction and maintenance.
            <p> 
               Connections between the rules of the technosphere and the dynamics of multicellularity are also apparent. Consider, for instance, an organism‚Äôs immune 
               system and rules ‚ë† (Inaccessibility) and ‚ë£ (Reciprocity): Unlike the immune cells' ability to recognize and work to neutralize harmful substances 
               and microbial pathogens, it is nearly impossible for the higher-level individual to engage in direct and precise interactions with local variables at this 
               scale. The aggregate agent at the highest level (i.e. the multicellular organism) must rely on the activity of lower-tier parts to engage with other systems 
               and events that share the same stratum in order to enable defense against infection (as well as contribute to the more existential process of distinguishing 
               the boundaries of an organism's selfhood). Recall rules ‚ë° (Impotence) and ‚ë¢ (Control) as well: multicellularity provides numerous examples of organizational 
               constraints of autonomous cell behaviour in order to facilitate the collective integrity of the emergent individual, including, but not limited to, 
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis">apoptosis</a>, the activities of tumour suppressor genes, the canalization of stem cells into 
               specialized and differentiated cells and tissues, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2016.0555">
               bioelectric networks and top-down morphogenetiic control</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis">homeostatic regulation</a> of 
               body temperature, blood pressure, and more. Moreover, while units are various levels of the hierarchically organized system cannot deploy exact control of
               any given system within the global whole, they can influence its behaviour through certain activities within their local stratum, such as when an agent 
               selects certain foods (such as those rich in antioxidants) and behaviours (such as refraining from smoking, optimal sleep, and exercise) which support the 
               functioning of a health immune system, or when immune cells function to support the cohesion and operation of the higher-level agent that it is located 
               within. All of that is to say, no individual part, nor subset of individual parts, can ever be causally responsible for a system‚Äôs 
               behaviour and each are instead constrained by emergent dynamics that enable the maintainence of higher-stratum systemic viability, channeling the behaviour 
               of said components in such a way to more effectively enable the system's adaptation and persistence. 
            <p>
               Naturally, Deacon attempts to account for the evolution of multicellularity as a hierarhichal transition following the familiar logic of functional 
               duplication, degradation, and synergistic interaction, dedicating a whole section of his <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264722001514?via=ihub#bib40">
               Biosystems article</a> to squaring this phenomenon with his framework. To do this, he draws heavily on the recent work of 
               theoretical biologist and bioengineer <a href="https://ronininstitute.org/research-scholars/felipe-veloso/">Felipe Veloso</a>, whose research
               demonstrates the importance of a shift in control from intracellular genetic interactions to extracellular relational constraints and the regulation
               of gene expression in the development of individuated multicellular organisms.
            <p>
               Here is Deacon once more, describing some principle features of the hierarchic transition to multicellularity: 
            <p class="quote">
               "Analogous to the different hierarchic transitions described in previous sections ... functional redundancy can lead to 
               higher-order synergies and complexity via lower-level degeneracy. Offloading aspects of gene regulation onto the extracellular environment (which 
               constitutes the higher-order organism) frees up intracellular mechanisms so that they might be recruited for new complementary functions and thus 
               more complex and diverse cell phenotypes ... To the extent that this extracellular redundancy enables subsequent degeneration of intracellular 
               genetically based regulation, previously autonomous cells would become increasingly dependent on their multicellular environment, while at the 
               same time increasing the probability that different cell lineages will develop complementary functions."
            </p>
            This logic also extends to the cell-to-cell interactions that guide morphogenetic patterning, cellular differentiation, and the global geometry of 
            the multicellular organism. Such activity goes beyond genetic regulation to include physical contact and molecular diffusion, as well as 
            signalling across considerable intercellular distances in the case of the nervous system and its coupling with extrinsic sensory experience. As one might 
            expect, "this suggests that the subordination of cell functions to the requirements of their collective synergy emerged as lower-level functional autonomy 
            degraded in the context of redundant higher-order influences. In this way the evolution of the complex forms exhibited by multicellular bodies‚Äîincluding 
            animal brains‚Äîalso appears to be a consequence of an analogous duplication-degradation process that ultimately shifts phenotypic control to the 
            higher-order synergy that constitutes the multicellular organism."
            <p> 
               In closing this section I wish to emphasize the notion of autonomy degradation that plays a key role in both Deacon and Haff's theories. For Haff, this 
               relationship is implied by the way in which his set of basic dynamical rules describe certain conditions of human subordination to the 
               requirements of scale and organization, reinforcing "the idea of humans as parts of, rather than simply creators and users of, modern technology."
               Our species' relationship to, and interactions with the technosphere suggests that humans are "parts of a dynamic and uncontrollable Earth 
               system from which they cannot escape and in whose service they labor." For Deacon, this type of relationship is an inevitable consequence of a generic 
               process of hierarchic transitions in evolution, that is to say, a phenomenon thought to have occured multiple times, at multiple scales, in multiple 
               biological substrates, throughout the history of life on earth. Whenever a process emerges that features collective synergy among individual units and 
               the extrinsic displacement of their functionality onto the organizational relations between coupled systems, one should expect to see an accompanying 
               degradation of the autonomy of lower-level units as they transition to the status of components of a novel emergent whole. 
            <p>
               A similar account is also offered by biologist and philosopher <a href="https://liberalstudies.duke.edu/people/faculty/daniel-w-mcshea">Daniel W. McShea</a> 
               under the designation of <a href= "https://sites.duke.edu/mcshearesearch/files/2014/03/Complexity-drain-McShea.pdf">"complexity drain."</a> McShea's work 
               in this area focuses on the hypothesis that as hierarchical transitions occur the component organisms will tend to lose functional capabilities and internal
               parts. In other words, whether transitions take place as a result of collective associations among individual cells (such as those amongst free-living
               prokaryotic cells in the development of the eukaryotic cell, or eukaryotic cells in the origins of multicellularity) or multicellular entities 
               (such as insects forming individuated colonies), there is an expectation for component organisms to lose complexity in function and part counts. While McShea's
               work to date tests this occurance solely at the cellular level, comparing the number of part types in protists and the cells of metazoans and land plants, his 
               findings are consistent with the complexity drain hypothesis and point to further extensions of the study in the form of more nuanced quantitative analyses and 
               testing at the level of colonial organisms or eusocial colonies.   
            <p>
               In a 2017 paper titled <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-33038-9_123-1">Evolution of Complexity</a>, McShea provides 
               an abbreviate overview of this area of research and some different examples: 
            <p class="quote">
               "...there is some data to suggest that there is a connection in fact, more specifically, that as a new higher level emerges, parts are lost at the next level 
               down, what has been called a complexity drain (McShea 2002; O‚ÄôMalley et al. 2016). In the emergence of the eukaryotic cell, the eubacteria that evolved into 
               mitochondria became simpler, losing molecular components. More generally, it is thought that in multispecies bacterial associations, one level up from 
               solitary bacteria, certain species may tend to lose the molecular machinery associated with certain metabolic functions as other species in the association 
               take over those functions (also known as the ‚Äúblack queen‚Äù effect). Also, in multicellular organisms, the cells have fewer part types on average than 
               free-living protists (McShea 2002). To see this, consider an extreme case, human blood cells, which have essentially no parts at all, compared to free-living 
               protists, which have many. Finally, there is some reason to think that the same pattern of loss occurred in the origin of intensely social/colonial organisms: 
               as the individuals in clonal associations differentiated into multiple types (castes in insects, polymorphs in marine invertebrates), they lose parts, becoming 
               simpler as they specialized."
            </p>
            This loss of part types and functional capability is essentially analogous to a loss of autonomy, as this drain on complexity is associated with a reduction in 
            the range of behaviours of component organisms in ways which limit their ability to operate as discrete and functionally independent units. McShea 
            further reiterates this view a number of times in his 2002 paper <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/mcshearesearch/files/2014/03/Complexity-drain-McShea.pdf">A Complexity 
            Drain On Cells In The Evolution Of Multicellularity</a>, in relation to not only a weakening of autonomy at the cellular level in multicellular organisms, but 
            also in "...the emergence of coloniality as a weakening of the individuality of the lower-level units (e.g., zooids, castes)" compared with those of related 
            free-living species, and the simplification of behavioral repertories of individual insects in highly individuated colonies. 
            <p> 
               Deacon also briefly remarks on eusociality, referencing his <a href-"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303264722001514">"social addiction"</a> 
               hypothesis which seeks to explain pro-social organismal behaviour, such as altruism and cooperation, in terms of the "prior degeneration of autonomous capacities" 
               (e.g. foraging, defending against predation) "due to prolonged relaxed selection in a context where these are available in excess." For Deacon and his co-author 
               <a href="https://berkeley.academia.edu/JulieHui">Julie Hui</a>, if prolonged relaxation and degeneration "reaches a point of irreversible loss, maintenance of 
               co-dependence becomes necessary" and "social cooperation is no longer optional" as "any threat to social cohesion becomes a threat to everyone‚Äôs survival." 
               Echoes of these ideas resonate through Haff's perspective on the technosphere as well, however, in this case, co-dependence is not limited to cooperation
               among human actors and the emergent social relations that structure their cohesion. Our contemporary planetary technological system is now deeply implicated in 
               governing our cooperation with a complex, planetary hybrid system characterized in part by "incentives such as abundant food, medicines, instant communication 
               channels and other desiderata that bind, or even addict, 
               humans to the system that produces them, as well as by less subtle mechanisms expressed via legal, judicial, political, military and other elements of the 
               technological armory." Cohesion is therefore distributed across a techno-bio-social system with sentient components operating at a global scale, and as this 
               dynamical system becomes increasingly individuated, threats to its viability (i.e. behaviour that is too autonomous, or unaligned with the 
               synergistic co-dependency and limited behavioural repetoire required to serve the interests and ensure the stability of the technosphere) become threats to 
               our own survival.

            <p class="subtitle">Concluding Thoughts
            <p>
               I'd like to end with a few thoughts about future directions for research, as well as some critical reflections on what I've written so far. Having initially 
               engaged solely with his earlier presentation on hierarchic transitions, I was surprised that Deacon did not turn his attention to the subject of technology 
               in any great detail. It's not exactly an arcane or marginal perspective to see technology as a universal anthropological phenomenon which exteriorizes 
               physiological and cognitive capabilities and is deeply correlated with human social and cultural activity. To be fair, however, in his more recent text, Deacon 
               does gesture towards an analysis of stone-age technology and its contribution to relaxed selection for masticatory adaptations, foraging behaviour, and sexual
               selection in prehistorical hominins. To my mind, another potentially interesting complementary example is the co-evolutionary synergies between certain physiological,
               behavioural, and cognitive adaptations and our use of fire to outsource digestion and provide new sources of warmth, lighting, protection from predation, and so on. 
               That is to say, following its discovery as a naturally occurring material and energetic process, as members of the genus Homo made practical use of fire it 
               may have induced a number of anatomical and cognitive transformations, including the size, shape, and function of the brain, teeth, and digestive tract (e.g. see 
               <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/evan.20275">1</a>, <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/204350">2</a>, 
               <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.316.5831.1558">3</a>). Moreover, there is <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2101108118">
               some evidence</a> to suggest this technological innovation may have also been strongly associated with the developemnt of novel cultural mechanisms related 
               to its transmission and persistence as a widespread feature of human life. Perhaps there's a story to be told about the <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1002/evan.20275">
               "long evolutionary history of an obligate dependence on fire"</a>, its relationship to the logic of duplication, relaxation, degradation, and synergistic 
               interaction, and even its place in the broad historical development of <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1038/s41559-017-0138">planetary energy expansions</a> 
               and the arrival of the modern technosphere. Examples such as this could also add to a more nuanced image of how complexity drain or degradation manifests 
               at certain scales (such as the organ level) while enabling evolutionary novelty at a higher strata (e.g. at cognitive and techno-socio-cultural levels).  
            <p>
               Another possible thread to explore would be evaluating different perspectives on how to explain phenomena like hierarchical transitions and its relationship
               to individuation and autonomy in complex dynamical systems. As I noted earlier in this text, there is a diverse literature on these and related topics and a 
               more pluralist account could help us establish more clearly the explanatory limits of any individual thinker or set of ideas, theories, or models. 
               This <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/perspectival-realism-9780197555620?cc=us&lang=en&">multi-perspectival</a> approach might also enable a  
               more comprehensive understanding of the subject at hand by incorporating heterogeneous perspectives at multiple levels of analysis. For instance, theories related
               to the concepts of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sres.3850050107">organizational closure in social</a> and

               and <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/author/alicia-juarrero-3467/">Alicia Juarrero</a>, could go a long way in furnishing this text with alternative yet 
               kindred frameworks for thinking through the ideas presented here. 
            <p>
               Take the 2015 book <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-017-9837-2">Biological Autonomy: A Philosophical and Theoretical Enquiry</a> by Moreno
               and Mossio, where the authors address, among other things, the question of biological organization and identity relative to levels of autonomy in pluricellular 
               systems. In their account, organisms can establish ‚Äústrong interactions with each other, giving rise to several different types of stable associations‚Äù with 
               ‚Äúdifferent degrees of cohesion‚Äù which ‚Äútend to occupy new niches and to increase the chances of survival of both the constituting units and the associations 
               themselves as a whole.‚Äù They also ask whether the constituting biological units of these integrated pluricellular systems are ‚Äústill autonomous entities or 
               just non-autonomous parts of an encompassing autonomous system.‚Äù This theoretical framework employs more generalizable concepts (such as 
               structural-coupling and organizational or regulatory constraint) and more fine-grained classifications (such as varying degrees of cohesive associations and 
               different types of stable associations along a continuum of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21162371/">organizational closure</a>) that may afford 
               more flexible and encompassing applications to the topic at hand. This could be a more advantageous theoretical approach than seeking correlations between the 
               functionality and degradation of a genome, as it often seems to be the case in Deacon's work, and the dynamics of massively complicated systems involving 
               numerous social, behavioural, biological, and technological factors. 
            <p>
               Granted, the productivity of Moreno and Mossio's formulations would hinge on their ability 
               to be extend to encompass questions regarding hybrid systems of both organisms and artefacts. A valid criticism in this respect would regard the limitations of treating 
               the coupling of biological and technological systems, and the coupling of biological systems alone, as equivalent phenomena. For example, is it accurate to 
               classify the technosphere as a quasi-autonomous or nascently invididuated unit in the same way that we might with complex aggregate biological systems, such as 
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siphonophorae">siphonophores</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superorganism">superorganisms</a>, or 
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holobiont">holobionts</a>? Does the technosphere truly exhibit properties or functions like metabolism, reproduction, 
               or self-preservation in a way that is comparable to living systems? These kinds of questions point to a more critical perspetives which suggests that the resemblance 
               between organismal systems, artefactual systems, and hybrid or composite systems of the two, might not justify their conflation. Each may require much more precise 
               and differentiated theorization in order to truly illuminate the dynamics shaping these related yet distinct processes. Then again, a more pluralist and comprehensive 
               approach could also help to reconcile these approaches fruitfully. For instance, we might might draw from 
               <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.650726/full">developments in synthetic morphology and evolutionary robotics</a> which 
               advocate for a shift in perspective regarding the boundaries between evolved and designed systems. Or we might be inclined to integrate 
               <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/ai-is-life/">recent work</a> by astrobiologist and theoretical physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Imari_Walker">
               Sara Imari Walker</a> which argues that technology in the broadest sense‚Äì‚Äìfrom pencils to satelittes, microscopes, LLMs and the computational devices they run 
               on‚Äì‚Äìis in fact continuous with life and its evolution. For Walker, the emergence of planetary-scale computation can be seen as an evolutionary progression, similar 
               to that which governs the development of biological systems, whereby the Earth and its biosphere is beginning to transition into a technosphere.     
            <p> 
               On this note, it is also worth asking: if the evolutionary development of hybrid techno-bio-social systems is shaped by similar principles to those operating in 
               coupled biological systems, where might we locate the technosphere along a spectrum of systems exhibiting varying degrees of stable associations and cohesion? 
               How equivalent are the organizational dynamics of the technosphere to those of a multicellular organism or a eukaryotic cell? It would seem extremely premature 
               to see a strict identity between these types of biological phenomena and this current stage of planetary technological civilization. Though, as per the underlying thrust 
               of this text, it may be worth thinking of the latter as analogous to the very earliest phases of obligate symbiosis. That is to say, the sentient componenets of the 
               technosphere may not be coupled with their host system to the same extent as a mitochondrion organelle is with the eukaryotic host cell. Yet, as I have attempted 
               to sketch in this text, we nontheless appear to be on a trajectory towards irreversible co-dependence or obligate coupling, constituted by organizational constraint, 
               a marked loss of autonomy, and relatively strong interactions and stable associations with the technosphere. To my mind, it is therefore very plausible that we have 
               already ventured a few steps through the generic sequence of phases that we would expect to occur in the evolutionary process of a hierarchic transition with 
               the technosphere.  
            <p>
               Questions which aim to better understand this trajectory could touch on whether certain thresholds exists across different types of systems, 
               with similar underlying dynamics, that would mark a kind of tipping point into irreversible synergistic and co-dependent coupling. If so, how might we locate, or 
               approximate, where such thresholds might lie and what their effects are predicted to be? This manner of inquiry might also benefit from integrating perspectives 
               related to ideas such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence">path-dependence</a> or <a href="https://www.isecoeco.org/pdf/techlkin.pdf">lock-ins</a>, 
               and the various methods for conceptualizing, modelling, and studying these kinds of occurances. Although these concepts are not precisely synonymous, they both 
               more-or-less describe how particular technologies become increasingly and systemically integrated into a social and/or broader environmental context in such a way 
               that the space of alternatives becomes reduced in a progressively inflexible and possibly irreversible manner. This process is notably historical, whereby small 
               events, sometimes driven by chance, can be magnified by positive feedback within a socio-technical, economic, and cultural system (including, but not limited to 
               phenomena such as: <a href="https://sites.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/increasingreturns.htm">increasing returns</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">
               network effects</a>, <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=5Aekhze2e8sC&oi=fnd&pg=PA149">interrelatedness of components</a>, 
               <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2586011">collective action problems</a>, <a href="https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19936716128">institutional 
               incentives</a>, and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/switchingcosts.asp">high switching costs</a>). This feedback can propel the system towards a 
               state where all options within the range of its possible trajectories are no longer equiprobable. These ideas, and other related concepts within complexity science, 
               the sociology and history of science and technology, science and policy studies, and the history of technological change, are worth unpacking in detail in relation
               to Haff's thoughts on the quasi-autonomous regulatory feedback loops of the technosphere and their role in preserving its stability against disruption.  
            <p> 
               Finally, and relatedly, if there are indeed basic principles related to organizational constraint, hierarchic transitions, and degradation of autonomy, as described 
               by Haff, Deacon, McShea, and others, that are consistent across a multitude of complex systems, including techno-bio-social hybrids, it seems relevant to contemplate 
               the implications for both political and ethical theories regarding human action in a world of diminished control over emerging planetary systems of historically 
               unprecedented size and impact. Haff ventures very briefly into this area, touching on topics like the consequences of ecological degradation, global warming, 
               world population, high-metabolism technology, waste product recycling, and external environmental and thermodynamic challenges to the stability of the technosphere‚Äôs 
               growth conditions. Although Haff does not attempt to offer much in the way of solutions to these problems, he does emphasize the significance of recycling 
               metabolic waste generated by the technosphere, writing that "unlike earlier Earth paradigms, which recycle most of their waste products, the technosphere does little 
               recycling. The future of the technosphere as a paradigm rather than just an episode in Earth history is contingent upon the emergence of effective recycling mechanisms." 
               Haff is insistent, however, that any effort to facilitate recycling will require an <i>increase</i> in energy expenditure and that "the framework for our decisions and 
               choices [regarding this transformation and the accompanying cultural, political, and policy factors] will be shaped and guided by the needs of the technosphere 
               as well as by human needs."
            <p>
               It would therefore be timely, if not imperative, to explore these ideas in depth, and with urgency, possibly with greater input from 
               complexity science, biology, science and technology studies, philosophy, and other associated disciplines. For the range of hypothetical interventions into the 
               evolution of large-scale technological systems, and the ability to freely implement any of them, may not be something our species can take for granted. And if 
               this is true, not just of our current relationship to the technosphere, but also for a variety of other natural and artificial complex systems which humans are 
               entwined with, then we may be driven to retool how we think about ethics and governance in relationship with techno-bio-social planning and design, and notions of 
               autonomy, agency, control, and individuality in this context. That is to say, we may benefit from using knowledge about which natural regularities of complex 
               hierarchical systems constrain human action to assess which normative frameworks, or which political systems or modes of social organization, might be the most salient 
               and beneficial for governing human behaviour relative to the many systems which we may find ourselves coupled with now and in the future.
