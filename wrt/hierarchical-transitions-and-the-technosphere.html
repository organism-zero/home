     Hierarchical Transitions and the Rules of the Technosphere
  </div>
  <div class="p"><img class="txtimg" src="sphereFolding.jpeg"></p>
  <div class="p">
     Last year I had an opportunity to attend an Environmental Humanities graduate seminar at the University of British Columbia with 
        <a href="https://mcmaster.academia.edu/DerekWoods">Derek Woods</a>. Although I was unable to register because of a full course load,
        I dropped in on a single session where the topic of discussion was ‚ÄúPlanetary Technics.‚Äù During the seminar I started contemplating some 
        hazy connections between certain themes in a paper we‚Äôd read about large-scale technological systems (which I‚Äôll introduce in the 
        following section) and some ideas in theoretical biology about the dynamics of collective interaction and major hierarchic 
        transitions. The following text is an attempt to flesh out these conceptual relationships in some more detail. 
     <p>
     This piece is a work in progress. Initially, I‚Äôd only intended to engage with two resources, one text and one lecture, putting them in 
        dialogue with one another to tease out their resemblances and chart future research directions. Naturally, as I was writing I encountered
        new references that complemented this project and new texts, ideas, and thinkers began to orbit around my efforts. I‚Äôve 
        done my best to integrate some of these new resources into the text but it‚Äôs definitely far from complete. My hope is that I‚Äôll 
        continue developing this line of thought long after this piece has been shared with you here, especially as it has become increasingly 
        apparent to me that this topic is much richer than I‚Äôd first imagined.
     <p style="font-size: 30px; padding-bottom: 5px; border-bottom: 1.5px dotted black">Introducing the Technosphere
     <p>
     The required readings for the seminar that week touched on a range of topics related to technology, media, geology, ecology, 
        capitalism, and the¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere">noosphere</a>. Among these publications was
        <a href="https://cee.duke.edu/faculty/peter-haff">Peter Haff</a>‚Äòs¬†<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053019614530575">Humans 
        and Technology in the Anthropocene: Six Rules</a>, a fascinating paper on the quasi-autonomous dynamics of planetary-scale technological systems. 
        In the text, Haff attempts to encapsulate said dynamics using the following six rules:
     <p>
     <p style="margin-left: 30px"> 
        ‚ë† The rule of inaccessibility 
     <br>
        ‚ë° The rule of impotence 
     <br>
        ‚ë¢ The rule of control 
     <br> 
        ‚ë£ The rule of reciprocity 
     <br> 
        ‚ë§ The rule of performance 
     <br>
        ‚ë• The rule of provision 
     </p>
     <p>
     Each of these rules express an important feature of large-scale technological systems which defines how humans are compelled to operate in 
        relation to them (I'm not going to elaborate on each of these rules, so curious readers should pause here and glance at the text 
        linked above if they want to be more holistically informed). While there are evidently many possible ways to conceive of something as 
        general as ‚Äúlarge-scale technological systems‚Äù, Haff‚Äôs specific subject of interest is what he calls the <i>technosphere</i>. Let me 
        start off by describing what this means so I can set the stage for the connections I‚Äôm interested in exploring between 
        his work and the idea of hierarchic transitions in biology.
     <p>
     In an academic context, the word ‚Äútechnosphere‚Äù seems to have made its first appearance in a <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1109/MSPEC.1968.5214690">
        1968 text</a> by biomedical engineer and biological control-theory researcher J. H. Milsum, although Haff has certainly made the term his 
        own through a number of publications produced in the last decade or so (e.g. see <a href="www.pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/Haff 2013 Technology as a Geological Phenomenon.pdf">
        1</a> and <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1177/2053019616677743">2</a>), many of which were thematically allied with a growing literature on 
        the Anthropocene. For Haff, the technosphere is said to be the technological analogue to the various natural geological paradigms, or 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_Earth_sciences#Earth's_spheres">planetary spheres</a>, that constitute and sustain the Earth 
        system, such as the geosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, or the biosphere. Haff notes, for instance, that all of the aforementioned 
        systems are global in their extent, autonomous to some degree, and involve the widespread appropriation of resources. General commonalities
        aside, a quick and dirty definition of the technosphere is as follows:  
      
     <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        A global interconnected system of 
     </p>
     <p style="margin-left: 50px">
        ‚óè Technical artifacts 
     <br>
        ‚óè Social structures
     <br>        
        ‚óè Physical infrastructure 
     </p>
     <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        which constitute
     </p>
     <p style="margin-left: 50px">
        ‚óè The totality of the built human environment
     <br>
        ‚óè The particular energy and resource transformations underpinning the system‚Äôs ‚Äúmetabolic‚Äù profile
     <br>        
        ‚óè The emergent principles that govern our relationship with it. 
     </p>
     <p>
     As evidenced by this definition, the technosphere is not simply the aggregate of all technological objects‚Äì‚Äìmuch like the biosphere is not the 
        mere sum of all planetary biomass‚Äì‚Äìbut rather has dynamic emergent properties that result from the organization of its various components 
        and the associations between them, including constraints, incentives, deterrents, and other relational processes associated with the system‚Äôs 
        functioning. This is to be clearly understood, and I‚Äôll return to this point in a moment. 
     <p>
     We can get a more comprehensive view of what is meant by the technosphere in Haff's own words by turning to the following passage from a 2014 text 
        titled <a href="https://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/Haff 2013 Technology as a Geological Phenomenon.pdf">Technology as a Geological Phenomenon: 
        Implications for Human Well-Being</a>:
     
     <p style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 22px">
     ‚Äú[The technosphere is]‚Ä¶the set of large-scale networked technologies that underlie and make possible rapid extraction from the Earth of large 
        quantities of free energy and subsequent power generation, long distance, nearly instantaneous communication, rapid long-distance energy and 
        mass transport, the existence and operation of modern governmental and other bureaucracies, high-intensity industrial and manufacturing 
        operations including regional, continental and global distribution of food and other goods, and a myriad additional ‚Äòartificial‚Äô or 
        ‚Äònon-natural‚Äô processes without which modern civilization and its present 7 √ó 109 human constituents could not exist. If the term 
        ‚Äòanthroposphere‚Äô is meant to emphasize the role of human beings as causative agents responsible for Earth transformations that define the 
        Anthropocene, the use of ‚Äòtechnosphere‚Äô suggests a more detached view of an emerging geological process that has entrained humans as 
        essential components that support its dynamics.‚Äù  
     </p>
     
     <p>
     Haff once more, from his more recent article: 
            
     <p style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 22px">
     ‚ÄúThe technosphere includes the world‚Äôs large-scale energy and resource extraction systems, power generation and transmission systems, communication,
        transportation, financial and other networks, governments and bureaucracies, cities, factories, farms and myriad other ‚Äòbuilt‚Äô systems, as well
        as all the parts of these systems, including computers, windows, tractors, office memos and humans. It also includes systems which traditionally
        we think of as social or human-dominated, such as religious institutions or NGOs. The Haber-Bosch process and associated technologies, 
        responsible through synthetic fixation of nitrogen and distribution of resulting fertilizers for providing about 40% of the world‚Äôs dietary 
        protein (Smil, 2002), is a specific example of a globally distributed component of the technosphere.‚Äù
     </p>
     
     <p>
     These excerpts highlight the many processes enabled by our planetary system of interrelated technological artifacts as well as the artifactual 
        subsystems which the technosphere comprises, i.e. the various contemporary networked technologies nested within the global system. Both of these 
        aspects (built artifacual systems and the myriad dynamic processes they facilitate) are continuous in the descriptions above and draw our attention 
        to the sheer scale of the technosphere and the scope of what this planetary technological system is composed of, or what sort of component systems 
        and processes might be thought to consitute its identity. From relatively simple products like office memos and fertilizer, to complex intergenerational
        socio-cultural forms like religious institutions, cities, and governments, the magnitude of the technosphere is vast and totalizing, assimilating 
        nearly all phenomena connected to the workings of contemporary human civilization, including the behaviour of human subjects themselves.
     <p>
     This leads us directly to one of the central aspects of Haff‚Äôs theory of large-scale technological networks: i.e. his insistence on a shift in our 
        thinking away from the ‚Äúnatural assumption that the technosphere is primarily a human-created and controlled system‚Äù and towards ‚Äúthe idea that 
        the workings of modern humanity are a product of a system that operates beyond our control and that imposes its own requirements on human 
        behaviour.‚Äù Haff notes that others have taken a similar position before, in other scholarly contexts, particularly political and social theorists 
        writing about the emergence of modern autonomous technological systems "whose works go a long way toward disabusing the notion that humans operate
        as independent agents in the modern technological world."  
      <p>  
      One way of thinking about this relationship between human agents and the technosphere is to frame it in terms of how organization and constraint operates
        in dynamic systems. I'll expand on this more once we get into the biology of hierarchic transitions, but the gist is that in order for a complex 
        dynamic system to persist through time and space, that is, to maintain some systemic coherent unity at a relevant temporal and spatial scale,  
        most of its component parts and processes must behave, and be organized in relation to one another, in a manner that is consistent with the system‚Äôs
        ability to reproduce itself as a unity. In other words, <i>systemic consistency and robustness requires functional organization, implying constraints
        on the degrees of freedom accessible to constituent components</i>. 
     <p>
     Once we're committed to conceiving of the technosphere as as a higher-level unity defined by organizational relations between coupled subsystems, 
        we can begin to see how the interests of human agents, as subordinate elements of the macro-system, must be constrained to some extent so as to 
        align with the properties and/or emergent principles of the complex dynamic system within which they are embedded. Haff's 2014 text supplies us
        with some examples of what these constraints could be, ranging from "hard" and tangible constraints like 
        architectural and infrastructural barriers, to "soft" and more abstract or normative regulations, such as incentives and deterrents for 
        behaviour that supports or interferes with the functioning of a given host system. Importantly, the intertwining of humans and the technosphere 
        also means that we are increasingly reliant upon its functioning to support our well-being and continuation as a species. 
     <p>   
     For instance, Haff puts forth the following estimation to really drive home the extent to which contemporary human 
        populations are beholden to the organizational constraints, and affordances, of large-scale 
        technological systems: "the pre-Anthropocene, pre-technological ‚Ä¶ human population was perhaps 10 million"
        and "the ramp-up of technology from pre-history through, e.g., dynastic China, Rome and medieval Europe to today‚Äôs global technology has led to 
        the expansion of this population to a level approaching 10 billion today ‚Ä¶ suggesting that on the order of 999 out of every 1000 humans owe their 
        existence and their wellbeing to technological systems." 
     <p>
     In the context of Haff‚Äôs immediate scholarship, the emphasis on this quasi-autonomous property of the technosphere motivates a somewhat idiosyncratic 
        perspective of how our networked technological systems, conceived of as a single emerging geological process, interfaces with other 
        Anthropocene-related phenomena in a manner which understates human autonomy over the production and transformations of the built environment. 
        After all, the Anthropocene denotes a geological epoch where significant impacts on the planet's climate and ecosystems are 
        the result of the activity of humankind, and therefore part of the uniqueness of Haff‚Äôs contribution to such discourse is to invert the 
        directionality of this causal relation. As Haff writes: "The technosphere is a system for which humans are essential but, nonetheless, 
        subordinate parts ‚Ä¶ This does not mean that humans cannot influence its behavior, but that the technosphere will tend to resist attempts to 
        compromise its function." Haff again: "humans have become entrained within the matrix of technology and are now borne along by a supervening 
        dynamics from which they cannot simultaneously escape and survive." 
     <p> 
     However as we'll see, the general framework of this perspective‚Äì‚Äìthat the emergent dynamics
        of the technosphere restrict and recruit human action to mutually support continued functioning of the resultant macrosystem‚Äì‚Äìwill also be crucial to 
        connecting this novel planetary-scale paradigm with certain evolutionary principles of biological complexity facilitated by hierarhical constraint,
        possibly providing new insight into both. 
     <p>
     To summarize: 
     <p>
     The technosphere is a composite system and planetary paradigm comparable to other geological phenomena whose components involve 
        everything from biological organisms to technological artifacts, social institutions, and emergent relational processes which both 
        enable and are enabled by the global system, ensuring the reciprocal survival and functioning of both itself and its natural and artificial 
        components. Conceptualizing the nature of large-scale technological systems in the aforementioned manner might also illuminate equivalences 
        between the dynamics of the emerging technosphere and certain hierarchically-nested biological systems.   
     <p>
     The remainder of this text will focus on Rule 5: Performance, and Rule 6: Provision, drawing comparisons between these principles and some of <a href="https://anthropology.berkeley.edu/terrence-w-deacon">
        Terrence Deacon</a> and <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/dmcshea">Daniel McShea</a>‚Äôs ideas about evolutionary synergies and hierarchic
        transitions in coupled systems and transformations in complexity and autonomy that accompany such processes. In order to make
        these connections, and clarify some of the terms I‚Äôve just introduced, I‚Äôm going to turn to some key points from 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWMEnIYEaQQ">a¬†talk</a>¬†that Deacon gave in 2017, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36075549/">
        a paper</a> published in 2022, each pertaining to the subject of hierarchic transitions in biological evolution.
