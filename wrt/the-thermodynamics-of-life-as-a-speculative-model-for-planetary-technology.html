            <p class="subtitle">Summary</p>
            <p>
               Originating from nineteenth century physics, the concept of entropy—a measure of disorder, randomness, and/or the 
               dissipation of useful energy—underlay a cosmology where order and complexity were seen as highly improbable phenomena 
               in a universe tending toward chaos and disorganisation. Nearly a century later, theoretical frameworks were developed for 
               understanding the production of entropy as an enabling feature of self-organized complexity in the natural world. 
               These ideas would contribute to reconciling the origins, development, and evolution of life with the principles of a 
               thermodynamic universe. For some, they also provided the conceptual foundations for theorizing about a natural 
               tendency within our thermodynamic universe—one which drives the development of increasingly complex and ordered 
               systems that amplify overall rates of entropy-production and energy dissipation. In this text I chart a path through 
               the aforementioned ideas and present their relevance in framing a relationship between our technological civilization 
               and the Earth system. I then turn toward the possibility and desirability of instantiating a future technosphere 
               aligned with thermodynamic principles of dissipation and entropy-production, drawing on recent developments in 
               bioengineering and synthetic biology to envision a paradigm where technology becomes living matter itself.

            <br>
            <p class="subtitle">Biology in the Context of Cosmological Entropy</p>
            <p>
               The concept of entropy originates from nineteenth century thermodynamics and is meant to describe a measure of disorder, 
               randomness, and/or the dissipation of useful energy in a system. In the most general sense, it’s often associated 
               with the idea that natural processes tend to move toward more disorderly states over time. A few simple examples 
               will serve to illustrate this concept. Consider a drop of ink inside a glass of water. Initially, the molecules
               which make up the ink are concentrated in a small area. However, as time passes, they disperse and spread throughout 
               the molecules of water, leading to a more disordered and random distribution. Eventually, the molecules will become 
               uniformly distributed within the glass, reaching a highly entropic state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Another 
               example is observed when you place a warm object, such as a cup of hot tea, inside a room with a lower temperature. 
               Over time, the temperature differential between the cup and the room will become equalized as heat, or thermal 
               energy, from the tea transfers to the surrounding molecules in the air of the room. Similar to the dissipation of 
               ink in water, the temperature of the tea and the room together will eventually reach an equilibrium where the 
               entropy of the total system has been increased and heat has been evenly distributed throughout the space. 
            </p>
            <img class="txtimg" src="entropy1.jpeg">
            <p>
               The latter example of heat flow in a system was precisely what physicist and mechanical engineer Sadi Carnot 
               discovered through his analysis of the efficiency of steam engines <a href="#e">[1]</a>: i.e. that heat always 
               moves down a gradient from hotter to colder states. This basic insight would later become the basis for the 
               second law of thermodynamics. The transformation of thermal energy into mechanical energy—as in the case of 
               a temperature differential powering a steam engine—also, perhaps unsurprisingly, involves the dissipation of 
               useful energy into the environment in the form of heat, becoming spread out into the surroundings and 
               therefore incapable of performing work once more.
            </p>
            <p>
               In the mid 1800s, Carnot’s idea would be refined by Lord Kelvin (William Thomson) and Rudolf Clausius, 
               <a href="#e">[2]</a> two seminal physicists who were instrumental in unifying the emerging field and providing 
               formal clarity and rigour to the notion of entropy as well as the first two laws of thermodynamics. Together, 
               these two laws describe a universal tendency toward the dissipation of mechanical energy in a cosmos where the 
               total amount of energy is fixed and conserved, while entropy refers to a measure of the energy in a system which 
               is no longer available for work. Physicist Ludwig Boltzmann supplemented these ideas with a statistical 
               interpretation of the second law which defined the tendency for orderly components of a system—particularly 
               molecules in a box—to spread out toward more probable arrangements, or dispersed and disorderly configurations, 
               until they approach a state of elevated entropy and thermodynamic equilibrium. It follows, therefore, that the 
               spontaneous generation of orderly configurations from disordered states was considered by Boltzmann to be infinitely 
               improbable. <a href="#e">[3]</a> These ideas played a significant role in shaping a cosmological model where living systems were 
               understood to be anomalous, improbable, and contingent accidents in a universe running down toward a “heat death”, 
               <a href="#e">[4]</a> with all its parts drifting toward increased disorder and degradation. <a href="#e">[5]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               However, unlike purely physical, non-living processes, biological systems seem to strike a peculiar balance between 
               the second law of thermodynamics and the ability to generate, maintain, and propagate complexity and order. This kind 
               of activity appears at odds with the above description of the nature of physical reality: if the state of the 
               universe is thought to be lurching toward an increase in cosmic disorder—as the second law of thermodynamics is 
               often interpreted—why then do we observe an abundance and increasing development of structure, order, organization, 
               and complexity within our planet’s biosphere? 
            </p>
            <p>
               During the last century, the notion of living systems as open dissipative systems operating in far from equilibrium 
               conditions has emerged as a compelling theoretical framework to clarify this enigmatic property of biology and reconcile it with 
               the laws of thermodynamics. <a href="#e">[6]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               In this view, living systems engage in a dynamic interplay with their environment, selectively exchanging matter and 
               energy with their surroundings in order to generate the work required to produce and maintain a self-organized state 
               of organic individuation and local entropy minimization. Put plainly, biological systems transform external resources 
               into internal order. 
            </p>
            <p>
               The process of localized entropy reduction embodied by self-organized living systems is non-contradictory with 
               respect to the physical laws it seems to elude, since the flows of matter and energy which instantiate organic form 
               necessitate the exogenous displacement of entropy from the living process in the form of waste and heat. This in 
               turn, consequently produces a global net increase of entropy within the surroundings of a given biological system. 
               In his pioneering work, <i>What Is Life?</i> physicist Erwin Schrödinger offered one of the earliest articulations of this 
               general idea. In Schrödinger’s words, what a biological system “…feeds upon is negative entropy. Or, to put it less 
               paradoxically, the essential thing in metabolism is that the organism succeeds in freeing itself from all the entropy 
               it cannot help producing while alive.” <a href="#e">[7]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               In Schrödinger’s writing, these intuitions about the generation and stabilization of order in organic systems are 
               supported by little empirical knowledge and expressed primarily through statistical equations and speculations about 
               the organism “feeding” upon negative entropy or “sucking orderliness from its environment.” <a href="#e">[8]</a> 
               Schrödinger would ultimately connect these ideas to the unique arrangement of molecules within “aperiodic solids” 
               with hereditary properties, a hypothesis which would later inform geneticists in their understanding of the 
               structure of DNA and its informational qualities. However, subsequent work by researchers in biochemistry, 
               biophysics, theoretical biology, complexity science, and other related areas, would also build upon Schrödinger’s 
               impressions to flesh out a more robust theory of the relationship between non-equilibrium thermodynamics, 
               self-organization, metabolism, and the complexity and order found in biological systems.

               In the following section, I turn to some of this work to provide an overview of the entangled and dialectic nature 
               of entropy and self-maintenance, organized complexity, and life. In doing so, I will highlight a spectrum of 
               self-organizing processes by tracing a continuum from simple dissipative systems to the thermodynamic principles 
               underpinning the activity and organization of living systems.

            <p class="subtitle">Dissipative Systems: From Self-Organization to Autopoiesis</p>
            <p>
               Physical chemist Ilya Prigogine’s work on complex dissipative systems is arguably one of the most significant 
               contributions to the line of thought connecting thermodynamic principles with the generation of natural order. 
               In a nutshell, dissipative systems—a term coined by Prigogine and his colleagues in a number of publications 
               during the late 1960s and first introduced at a conference on theoretical physics and biology <a href="#e">[9]</a>—
               are complex dynamic structures operating far from conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium. These open systems tend 
               to spontaneously self-organize into spatiotemporally ordered processes whose metastable steady states are reproduced 
               by exchanging energy and matter with their environments. Such systems can be both naturally occurring, like 
               whirlpools, flames, tornados, or Jupiter’s Giant Red Spot, as well as artificially generated, as in the case 
               of Bénard cells. <a href="#e">[10]</a> In a recent paper on the topic of Schrödinger’s <i>What Is Life?</i> lectures, 
               theoretical biologist Stuart Kauffman discusses the illustrative example of Bénard cells in some detail, which 
               is worth quoting at length: 
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
               “…there is a pan with a shallow layer of viscous liquid … heated slowly from below, creating a temperature gradient, 
               hotter on the bottom than top of the fluid. The temperature gradient induces an overall heat flow to the environment 
               … When the temperature gradient surpasses the Rayleigh threshold, convective cells arise and dissipate heat more 
               effectively. The convective cells are the Bénard cells … [whose] patterns are sustained by the continuous flow of 
               energy through the system that results by heating the pan from below.” <a href="#e">[11]</a> 
            </p>
            <img class="txtimg" src="benard1.jpeg">
            <p>
               Much like Bénard cells, cyclones such as tornados or hurricanes, and other similarly structured natural phenomena 
               like whirlpools or turbulent flow, maintain the emergent macroscopic patterns which constitute their dynamical form 
               through the incessant flux of their components, i.e. via the constant flow of energy and matter through the system 
               supplied by an energy gradient. In other words, the structural identity of a dissipative system is held constant by 
               a continuous flux of energy and matter from the environment, transformed into order locally and displaced as entropy 
               extrinsically. 
            </p>
            <p>
               We can see here the beginnings of a theory of natural phenomena which describes the tendency for order to emerge 
               from the enabling conditions of a thermodynamic universe. Not only is the relationship between entropy and life 
               considered non-contradictory, it is in fact dialectically entangled such that the production of entropy acts as a 
               generative natural condition for the emergence of order and complexity and not simply disorder and equilibrium. In 
               other words, entropy functions as a progenitor of dynamic order for a certain class of physical systems which 
               leverage or exploit, so to speak, the same thermodynamic principles which lead to disorganization and decay in 
               other contexts. The spontaneous development of complexity and organization is therefore equally as natural as the 
               propensity for chaos and disorder in a universe whose activity conforms with thermodynamic laws. <a href="#e">[12]</a>  
            </p>
            <p>
               This theoretical framing is also thought to provide a basis for understanding certain fundamental qualities of 
               biological systems as well. For instance, biophysicist Jeremy England has suggested that non-equilibrium physical 
               systems tend to vary in their structure over time in a manner which correlates with their ability to optimally 
               absorb and dissipate energy from their environment. England bridges physics and biology by connecting this 
               historical and quasi-adaptive property with the selective evolutionary dynamics of living systems, 
               <a href="#e">[13]</a> proposing maximal entropy production as a common principle driving the activity and 
               morphology of self-organizing physical systems, as well as minimal molecular systems and more complex biology. 
               Stuart Kauffman has also offered a related narrative in his work on self-organization and complexity, building on 
               various frameworks in the complexity sciences to study the relationship between laws of spontaneous order and 
               self-organization and questions regarding the origin and evolution of life.  For Kauffman, the universe supplies 
               order for free as a result of deeply natural laws shaping the behaviour of non-equilibrium systems. 
               <a href="#e">[14]</a> In this view, living systems are seen as expressions of the coupling of spontaneous, 
               self-organizing complexity and the dynamics of evolutionary selection. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Similarly, environmental scientist Eric Schneider and theorist Dorion Sagan have maintained that the tendency for 
               non-equilibrium systems to optimize for dissipation, via their exploitation of various energy gradients, is 
               fundamental to all complex structures and processes of biological reality—from the origin of life to evolution and 
               ecology. <a href="#e">[15]</a> The authors elevate this tendency to the status of a natural principle, arguing that 
               biological systems are enabled by the same physics of energy flow operating in non-living dissipative systems: 
               “[non-equilibrium thermodynamics] connects life to nonliving complex systems … life’s complexity is a natural 
               outgrowth of the thermodynamic gradient reduction implicit in the second law.” <a href="#e">[16]</a> Echoing this 
               sentiment in an earlier publication, biochemist Jeffrey Wicken has also linked thermodynamics with the historical 
               and ecological development of molecular and organismal complexity, arguing that “life’s emergence was not at all 
               accidental” but arose quite naturally from “the free energy gradients (solar and geothermal) of prebiotic Earth”, 
               discharging these gradients in the production of entropy during its continued evolutionary diversification.

            <p>
               We can also turn to Prigogine once again to explore a related set of ideas. One crucial theoretical development to 
               emerge from Prigogine and his collaborators’ work on dissipative systems was the Brusselator, a theoretical model 
               for an autocatalytic system. <a href="#e">[18]</a> Autocatalysis—or a process whereby one or more reaction products 
               act as a catalyst for the same reaction—can be seen as a minimal requirement for defining living systems and their 
               common metabolic and/or replicative properties. <a href="#e">[19]</a> These kinds of looping reaction cycles are 
               thought to be vitally important for describing self-organizing far-from-equilibrium thermodynamic structures as well 
               as certain regulatory mechanisms underpinning metabolic functioning and specific organizational processes unique 
               to biological systems. <a href="#e">[20]</a> Others have formulated analogous notions through the lens of their own 
               research, most notably Kauffman’s theory of autocatalytic sets and neuro-anthropologist Terrence Deacon’s model of 
               the autogen. With the latter, a synergetic loop between multiple thermodynamic self-organizing processes generates 
               the conditions for the maintenance and replication of a self-enclosed system and its autocatalytic components.  
               <a href="#e">[21]</a> A similar logic informs the idea of autocatalytic sets, whereby the general metabolic activity 
               and self-replicating behaviour which underlie all organismic activity is posited as a typical outcome of the dynamic 
               stability of autocatalytic networks. <a href="#e">[22]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               A handful of thinkers have also touched more specifically on the structural and organizational relationship between 
               the thermodynamic properties of open systems and the continuous flow of energy and matter which sustains the 
               self-organizing, self-maintaining, and self-producing behaviours of minimal biological systems. An early and 
               highly influential contribution to this area can be found in the research of neurobiologists Humberto Maturana and 
               Francisco Varela, whose work on autopoiesis highlights not only the closed recursiveness of a self-producing 
               network of molecular relations (much like autocatalytic sets) but the necessary and enabling condition of such a 
               system to remain open to the flow of matter and energy through it. <a href="#e">[23]</a> That is to say, a 
               fundamental property of biological organization is its continuous realization through the process of incessant 
               material turnover. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Continuing in this tradition, theoretical biologists Alvaro Moreno and Matteo Mossio assert the need to ground this 
               unique property of biology in thermodynamics, qualifying living systems as “dissipative systems dealing in a 
               constitutive way with a thermodynamic flow that traverses them.” <a href="#e">[24]</a> This perspective is also 
               reflected in a recent compilation of essays titled <i>Everything Flows</i>, edited by philosophers and historians of 
               biology John Dupré and Daniel Nicholson. In their introduction, Dupré and Nicholson write of the organism's 
               existential condition of needing to be continuously thermodynamically active in order to exist. 
               <a href="#e">[25]</a>  Biological systems must metabolize matter from their surroundings to acquire and dissipate 
               energy, rebuild and replenish their cells, and maintain their identity in a steady state. In other words, an 
               organism's stability derives from a continuous circulation of its components driven by the non-equilibrium 
               dynamics of dissipating energy acquired from its environment. Like the Bénard cell, the maintenance of organized 
               and ordered living states, or dynamic biological stability, requires the constant thermodynamic stream of energy 
               through a system—biological entities systematically manage and constrain these flows, dissipating energy so as 
               to maintain themselves and their organization.

               Philosopher Rod Swenson has also explored related ideas in his work on the thermodynamics of self-organization, 
               ecology, and evolution. In his research, Swenson expounds upon a notion of autocatakinesis, or “identity through 
               flow” <a href="#e">[26]</a>, whereby both living systems and certain kinds of self-organizing physical systems 
               maintain the coherence of their dynamic spatio-temporal order through a circular causal regime governed by 
               far-from-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions. Swenson draws on the likes of Prigogine and Shrödinger, as well 
               as philosophers and scientists such as Heraclitus, Gottfried Wilhelm Liebniz, and Ludwig Von Bertalanffy, to 
               stress the connection between dissipative systems and living beings, both of which are open non-equilibrium 
               systems whose structural and organizational identity is constituted by continuous coordination of its parts via 
               the relentless flow and degradation of energy and matter from their respective environments. <a href="#e">[27]</a>

            <p>
               A relatively common theme among the authors referenced above is the idea that there is some directional trajectory 
               implicit in the emergent self-organizing and dissipative properties of non-equilibrium systems. That is to say, 
               many of these thinkers champion the view that life and all its various features are inevitable outcomes of a 
               physical reality shaped by thermodynamic principles. This lies in contrast with common cosmological interpretations 
               of entropy among physicists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century which saw life as an extremely 
               improbable and aberrant phenomenon that was inconsistent with the laws of physical reality. For some, this 
               alternative view motivates theoretical explorations of the relationship between thermodynamics and the origins 
               of rudimentary forms of intelligence, meaning, and/or cognition in living beings. <a href="#e">[28]</a>
               For others, an acceleration in the rate of entropy production and energy transformation realized by the history of 
               biological complexification also points to a tacit purposiveness in living systems of all scales to develop 
               toward increasingly sophisticated forms of energy exploiting and dissipation. It is the latter of such views 
               which I will describe in the following section, connecting it with theoretical frameworks such as Gradient Reduction 
               Theory and the Maximum Entropy Production Principle, and relating these perspectives to ideas regarding 
               planetary-scale energy transformations in the development of both natural and technological global spheres.

               As we’ve seen, a handful of researchers interested in the relationship between life. and open, dissipative, 
               nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems also seek to align their ideas with an historical or evolutionary framework 
               of some kind. <a href="#e">[29]</a> In the section that follows, I will highlight a few examples of such thinking, 
               each of which adopts a relatively unique approach to this theme, yet all of whom share a common theoretical 
               foundation in the dissipative properties of far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics. I will then highlight the 
               relevance of such thinking for framing the relationship between the Earth system and our modern technological 
               civilization.

            <p>
               One expression of this evolutionary, biospheric perspective of non-equilibrium systems is Gradient Reduction Theory 
               (GRT), proposed by Dorion Sagan and Earth scientist Jessica Hope Whiteside in their contribution to a 
               collection of essays regarding thermodynamics and the purpose of life. <a href="#e">[30]</a> In this publication, 
               Sagan and Whiteside explore the idea that non-equilibrium thermodynamics connects purely physical flow structures 
               to biological processes and systems of varying degrees of complexity—from prokaryotic metabolism to complex animals 
               and the biosphere, or “Gaia”, itself. Additionally, these biological systems are thought to be long-evolved 
               instantiations of an historical inclination belonging to all natural processes on Earth: i.e. a tendency in the 
               evolutionary development of far-from-equilibrium systems to accelerate increasingly efficient means of entropy 
               production or energy dissipation and transformation. <a href="#e">[31]</a> 
            </p>
            <p>
               For instance, Sagan and Whiteside propose that the widespread proliferation of humans relative to other species 
               “is in large part due to … a much enhanced ability to identify and deploy the food and other gradients necessary 
               to move agricultural and technical civilization into the material evolutionary form which is humanity.”  
               <a href="#e">[32]</a> They also argue that the thermodynamic imperative to exploit energy potentials points not only 
               to “the process of life’s origination…” but also a directionality to life’s development at the planetary scale, in 
               the form of “…growth (increase in biomass), reproduction, increase in respiration, energy efficiency, number and 
               types of taxa (biodiversity), rates of circulation of elements, numbers of elements involved in biological 
               circulation, and [an] increase in intelligence…”  <a href="#e">[33]</a> This sentiment is repeated in Sagan’s 2016 
               article <i>Möbius Trip: The Technosphere and Our Science Fiction Reality</i>, wherein he writes: “energy-driven 
               evolution shows trends ranging from expansion of the area inhabited by life to increase in respiration efficiency 
               … to increase in sensory modes, increase in information processed, and increase in energy stored, commandeered, 
               and deployed in life’s operations at Earth’s surface.” <a href="#e">[34]</a> For Sagan, this suggests “…a 
               more-than-human, thermodynamically driven, ecosystemic increase in biodiversity, net intelligence, perceptual and 
               metabolic modes … over evolutionary time.” <a href="#e">[35]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               We find a related perspective contained in the idea of the Maximum Entropy Production Principle (MEPP). According to 
               this view, non-equilibrium systems will develop toward optimizing for states where the rate of entropy production 
               via energy flux and dissipation is maximized given their environmental constraints. <a href="#e">[36]</a> In 
               addition to this generalized formulation, proponents hold that a variety of non-trivial features in the evolution 
               of life can be traced to this thermodynamic property of open systems. Physicist and mathematician Leonid Martyushev 
               has published extensively on the topic, drawing from the work of mathematical biologist Alfred Lotka, Earth systems 
               scientist Axel Kleidon, ecologist Howard Odum, and others to explore the relevance of the MEPP in describing 
               evolving biological systems. For Martyushev, the MEPP is “the most important principle explaining the direction 
               (progression) of biological and technological evolution” as it corresponds with “the increase in complexity of 
               living creatures in the course of evolution, the emergence of human beings, and the entire course of the 
               development of our civilization (from humans that started using fire to humans widely using oil fuel and atomic 
               energy).” <a href="#e">[37]</a> Increases in the complexity and organization of living systems—from microbes to 
               metazoans, ecosystems, and civilizations—are thought to develop in accordance with this common principle, whereby 
               “increasing the metabolic rate in order to maximize the consumption of free energy” drives “organisms [to] 
               gradually become more complex in a natural way.” <a href="#e">[38]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               In addition to these evolutionary explanations, contemporary advocates of the MEPP such as Martyushev, Kleidon, 
               and Odum also attest to the use of this theoretical framework in describing the activity of Earth system functioning and 
               the dynamics of energy flow through other large complex systems that are products of life’s activity, such as 
               societies and ecological networks. <a href="#e">[39]</a> The scope of theories such as GRT and the MEPP is 
               therefore broad enough to address questions related to the origin of life, its adaptive historical development, 
               and the various scales of its hierarchical organization—from bacteria to planetary civilization. At their 
               highest strata of application, these views encourage us to see the development and operation of large-scale 
               biospheric, social, and technological organization in accordance with a natural principle driving the energetic 
               dynamics of non-equilibrium systems.

               What we have then, are various researchers working in areas related to physics, chemistry, biology, philosophy, 
               complex systems, and Earth sciences who have developed kindred theoretical frameworks for understanding the production of 
               entropy as an enabling feature of self-organized complexity in the natural world. From this perspective, 
               spatiotemporally ordered systems tend to emerge spontaneously as a means to degrade energy at elevated rates, 
               with their recursive self-organized complexity facilitated by a continuous flux of matter and energy from the 
               environment. Living systems are similarly instantiated and have evolved more complex and specific means of 
               intentionally locating, exploiting, and dissipating free energy in order to self-produce, maintain, and replicate 
               their organizational identity. Phenomena such as this can therefore be understood as a natural outgrowth of the 
               second law of thermodynamics, underpinning nonequilibrium systems both nonliving and living alike. 
            </p>
            <p>
               This principle of energy dissipation may also be implicated in the growth and adaptive development of increasingly 
               complex living systems and certain products of their activity. This is thought to include evolutionary developments 
               in organismal complexity, ecosystemic biodiversity, social organization, and technological systems, and their total 
               contribution to an expanded rate of energy transformation occurring on this planet. In other words, adopting the 
               aforementioned perspectives on the role of entropy in the generation and development of biological order might 
               allow us to understand the activity of life at multiple levels—including aspects of human civilization such as the 
               technosphere <a href="#e">[40]</a>—in accordance with the conditions of a thermodynamic universe. In a sense, the 
               universal thermodynamic principle of entropy production lies at the heart of a worldview which naturalizes life’s 
               activity, situating it in a quasi-purposeful cosmos directed toward generating increasingly sophisticated 
               dissipative systems. 
            </p>
            <p>
               For the human species, a theory such as this could have a significant impact on how we frame the relationship 
               between our technological civilization and Earth system functioning. Insofar as we can talk about the evolutionary 
               development of human technologies, the pace at which such change has occurred—and will likely continue to occur—is 
               significantly more rapid than most phylogenetic change in the history of biological systems. 
               <a href="#e">[41]</a> This accelerated change in our technological landscape has also been at the center of 
               profound Anthropogenic transformations in multiple planetary spheres, while simultaneously imposing conditions of 
               critical interdependence between our species, the biosphere, and the continued viability of a functioning 
               technosphere. <a href="#e">[42]</a> Situating the technosphere within the context of a thermodynamic drive toward 
               enhanced rates of dissipation might therefore provide some sense of guidance as to how we might ensure the 
               viability of our technological systems by aligning aspects of their development with at least one crucial and 
               deeply natural feature of planetary life. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Indeed, some researchers have already made efforts to explore the relationship between planetary technology, 
               thermodynamics, and the Anthropocene, such as Axel Kleidon, who has written about the energetics of the 
               technosphere, “…the ultimate thermodynamic imperative to evolve to states of greater energy conversions and 
               higher levels of entropy production at the planetary scale…”, and the Earth system’s need for “…the technosphere 
               to make this evolutionary step to the next thermodynamic level of greater energy conversions.” 
               <a href="#e">[43]</a> How then might the technosphere complement the thermodynamic imperative that biological 
               systems seem to embody so effectively? How successful is the technosphere at dissipating energy and how does 
               it compare to living systems in this regard? In the final portion of this paper, I speculate about this particular 
               conceptual relationship between the Earth’s technosphere and biosphere by turning my focus toward the material 
               constitution of human technological artifacts. The following considerations will be used to structure and guide 
               this inquiry:

            <p style="margin-left: 30px">
               ◾  How does human technology differ from evolved, open, living nonequilibrium systems?
            </p>
            Many of the authors previously cited give us good reason to distinguish strongly between living systems such as 
            organisms, and artifactual systems such as machines. One major difference often emphasized is the dynamicity of 
            biology, compared to the static nature of mechanical artifacts. For instance, Rod Swenson writes of machines being 
            constituted by the static order of their functional components, all of which have been designed by an artificer. In 
            contrast with this, living systems are defined by their dynamic order, whose identity is “…constituted through the 
            incessant flux of their components, which are continuously being replaced from raw materials in their environments 
            and being expelled in a more dissipated form.” <a href="#e">[44]</a> All known extant human artifacts, machines, or 
            other technological devices and systems lack this metastable, autokatakinetic property of being enabled, 
            self-produced, and self-maintained by the dynamics of energy dissipation. 
            </p>
            <p>
               This difference has also been described in terms of the transitional and stable identities of biological systems and 
               machines, respectively. Daniel Nicholson writes that while “an organism naturally maintains itself in a state of 
               continuous flux” as a “temporary manifestation of the self-producing organizational unity of the whole”, a machine 
               and its components “remain distinct, stable, and identifiable over time.” <a href="#e">[45]</a> That is to say, living 
               systems are grounded in the thermodynamic principles which both constrain their behaviour and enable them to “break 
               down the materials they take in from their environment in order to acquire the energy they need to rebuild their 
               constituents … maintain themselves in a steady state far from thermodynamic equilibrium … and dissipate energy and 
               excrete material wastes back into their environment.” <a href="#e">[46]</a> Human technology does not function this 
               way in any credible sense, nor is its structural or organizational identity comparable to the processual dynamism of 
               open dissipative systems described here. <a href="#e">[47]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               Framed alternatively, biological systems are ascribed as having a much greater degree of autonomy than machines. Part 
               of what it means for dynamic organic order to be constituted by a flux of energetic and material processes is that 
               open systems of this kind acquire self-organizing and self-producing properties and functions which contribute to the 
               system’s own maintenance. By contrast, nearly all of our technological systems are allopoietic or heteropoietic: i.e., 
               many “have as the product of their functioning something different from themselves” and all must rely on human agency, 
               design, and intervention to become organized, perform functionally, and persist through time. <a href="#e">[48]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               Another salient difference between living and technological systems can be illustrated by their respective energy 
               dissipation rates. Drawing considerably on the work of environmental scientist Vaclav Smil, philosopher Thomas Nail 
               has argued that despite an exponential rise in human-induced energy expenditure during the last century the technosphere 
               is still orders of magnitude less effective than the biosphere when it comes to rates of energy expenditure and 
               dissipation, paling in comparison to biodiverse ecosystems, particular old-growth forests. <a href="#e">[49]</a> For 
               Nail, both vegetal and animal life are “massive energy-degrading [processes] of radical expenditure and waste”, with 
               plants acting as “powerful dissipative systems that degrade solar energy into low-grade heat energy, water, and oxygen” 
               and animals dissipating 80–90% of the energy they consume as heat. <a href="#e">[50]</a> Unlike these processes, our 
               present human civilization has only recently expanded its ability to consume energy, not dissipate it 
               <a href="#e">[51]</a>—one might say that our technological systems tend to optimize for power input and total consumption, 
               and not for energy dissipation. That is to say, despite an unprecedented era of accelerated, energy-intensive technological 
               development—one which characterizes the growth of the modern technosphere—our contemporary technological systems appear 
               largely incapable of matching the rates of energy transformation and expenditure measured in the highly entropic activity 
               of the biosphere.

               ◾  Could modelling our technology on the dialectic of entropy and life be advantageous for the viability of the technosphere?
            </p>
            <p>
               Foregrounding quantitative comparisons between the entropic properties of the technosphere and the biosphere is especially 
               interesting because it suggests that what some might see as a kind of “entropic” destruction brought about by our 
               contemporary fossil-fuel civilization is in fact quite different from the more widespread entropy-amplifying processes 
               which have characterized the history of life on Earth. If anything, humans have reduced the planet’s overall rate of 
               expenditure by eradicating dissipative biological systems, indirectly replacing them with technological systems of 
               inferior entropy-producing capabilities. Nail’s recent book <i>Theory of the Earth</i> builds on this idea in order to 
               advance an ethics of dissipative energy expenditure which advocates for bringing environmental politics and philosophy into 
               alignment with the thermodynamic principles shaping biospheric energy flow. I wish to argue in a similar direction: that 
               human technology might benefit from being aligned with the principles of nonequilibrium thermodynamics shaping the form 
               and activity of biological systems. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Orienting ourselves toward this possibility could reframe our relationship to technological systems much like how theories 
               regarding the thermodynamic principles of self-organization and biological order reframed life as a natural and expected 
               feature of the cosmos. That is to say, it may give us reason to see the potential for technology to become more like the 
               complex natural systems which appear to spontaneously emerge from, and thrive in, a thermodynamic universe. At the very 
               least, on a local scale, it may motivate us to imagine how we might engineer the technosphere and its artificial components 
               to be more reciprocally connected with the ubiquitous material and energy flows shaping bio-terrestrial expenditure. In 
               both cases, human technology could be guided toward a paradigm where it operates in harmony with, and not distinct from 
               or hostile to, natural living systems. At the core of this transformation in our theories and applications of technology 
               would be the objective to amplify its dissipative properties in a manner that reflects or reproduces the activity of 
               organic, open, nonequilibrium systems.

               ◾  How might theories of energy dissipation in living systems guide the design of human technology? 
            </p>
            <p>
               This question is a highly speculative prompt, to be sure, and should be considered as no more than a thought experiment. 
               I do not purport to offer any precise or concrete proposals for how one might go about developing living technology with 
               thermodynamic properties that accurately correspond to those exhibited by the biological systems discussed earlier in 
               the text. Instead, I wish to provide only a general sketch of this prospective technological future by pointing to a few 
               promising developments in bioengineering and synthetic biology, briefly elaborating on why these advances warrant further 
               attention in the context of our exploration of the dialectical relationship between entropy and open nonequilibrium systems. 
            </p>
            <p>
               One area of interest which may prove to be relevant to this conceptual endeavour is synthetic morphology. This emerging 
               sub-discipline of synthetic biology began to take shape around 2008, when developmental biologist Jamie Davies published 
               a paper outlining the prospects of engineering “self-constructing assemblies of cells.” <a href="#e">[52]</a> It could 
               be said that practitioners in the field are generally interested in understanding the rules of morphogenesis and their 
               application in the construction of devices using, or entirely comprised of, engineered living tissues. <a href="#e">[53]</a> 
               In other words, these researchers are interested in how living matter self-organizes, studying the unique properties of 
               individual cells and the collective behaviour they exhibit when assembling into various pluricellular configurations, 
               as well as using that knowledge to develop new hybrid living-technological systems. <a href="#e">[54]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               While thermodynamics does not currently play much of a role in this work, for our purposes, developments in synthetic 
               morphology point toward a horizon where technological systems are brought into even closer proximity with living 
               systems—not merely in an attempt to emulate biology, as is often the case in areas of biomimetic design, but by 
               comprehensively instantiating novel engineered systems which are composed of living matter itself. Learning to think 
               and design technologically using “agential materials” <a href="#e">[55]</a> would at least imply having to work with 
               the material and energetic properties that underpin relevant characteristics of nonequilibrium living 
               systems—characteristics such as self-organization, autopoiesis, adaptivity, and agency. <a href="#e">[56]</a> Efforts 
               in this field might also chart a path toward the symbiotic integration of a new class of biological artifacts into 
               the broader dissipative flows that characterize the thermodynamic activity of organisms and ecologies.
            </p>
            <p>
               This nascent field complements similar aims in other areas of synthetic biology, reflecting a general disposition 
               toward engineering technological systems using organic components and processes. These include applications in cellular 
               agriculture and other bioeconomic platforms, <a href="#e">[57]</a> experiments in the design and construction of built 
               environments grown using engineered living material, <a href="#e">[58]</a> as well as various efforts to transform 
               industrial processes involved in energy and fuel production, chemical, pharmaceutical, and material manufacturing, and 
               waste remediation via the commercial deployment of metabolically engineered molecular systems. <a href="#e">[59]</a> 
               Similarly, advances in biological computing at both the hardware and software level gesture again to the potential for 
               an emerging technosphere which could operate congruously with the dynamics of living systems due to being biologically 
               instantiated itself. A notable example of the former is the development of microprocessors powered by photosynthetic 
               algae, <a href="#e">[60]</a> while the latter has been demonstrated by early research into the use of stem cell-derived 
               neural organoids in biological computing. <a href="#e">[61]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               Once more, although thermodynamics does not appear to be central to the study, development, and evaluation of these 
               advances in synthetic biology, the general impetus to explore the frontiers of engineered systems comprised of biological 
               matter is a desired direction in the path toward living technology with embodied dissipative and metabolic properties. 
               <a href="#e">[62]</a> It may indeed be one of the first steps toward the construction of a technosphere which can begin to 
               match the amplified entropy-producing features of organisms and ecosystems. As researchers like Nail have indicated, 
               a significant fraction of the planet’s most effectively dissipative systems (living ecosystems) have been decimated 
               during the period of accelerated technological and economic growth which defines the Anthropocene, lowering the 
               planet’s total rate of entropic expenditure. <a href="#e">[63]</a> This loss cannot be compensated for by our contemporary 
               technosphere alone, as its dissipative properties are orders of magnitude less effective than the terrestrial 
               biosphere’s. By the same token, the planet’s biological systems may not be capable of evolving quickly enough to respond 
               to this change either, further deferring the emergence of higher-level systems of entropy production on the planetary 
               scale. So, along with the many practical measures we ought to take as a civilization to compensate for this 
               transformation, populating our planetary system with engineered, hybrid, bio-technological artifacts embodying the 
               properties of open nonequilibrium systems and processes might be a fruitful avenue for post-Anthropic terraforming in 
               service of restoring and ideally augmenting the thermodynamic imperative of net global dissipation rates, however 
               abstract or imaginative this may seem at present.

            <p class="subtitle">Conclusion</p>
            <p>
               In surveying a literature on the notion of entropy and its enabling role in the generation of self-organized complexity 
               in open nonequilibrium systems, a throughline can be traced from non-living physical systems to forms of biological 
               organization and activity at multiple scales—from individual autopoietic cells to planetary systems. The view that the 
               conditions of a thermodynamic universe provide an impetus to develop increasingly sophisticated vehicles for maximizing 
               planetary dissipation rates provides a conceptual paradigm for thinking about connections and divergences between two 
               global energetic systems: the biosphere and the technosphere. Drawing on theoretical and applied aspects of recent 
               developments in bioengineering and synthetic biology, we might aspire to imagine a future technosphere comprised of 
               living matter, whose material and energetic properties are more closely aligned with the thermodynamic principles of 
               dissipation and entropy production that permeate all natural ordered systems.

               <text class="enclr">It may be worth noting that Sagan and Whiteside technically do not subscribe to the notion that entropy is being 
                  explicitly maximized by the behaviour of gradient-degrading thermodynamic systems, preferring to focus the reader’s
                  attention on the energy flows alone which organize such systems. In their thinking, GRT is a restating of the second 
                  law of thermodynamics, albeit one which emphasizes energy potentials and flow through complex systems over universal 
                  net entropy production. Despite this, their explanation of the general mechanics of their subject of interest remains 
                  relatively similar to most thinkers in this area and the difference they highlight does not seem considerable enough 
                  to put them appreciably at odds with others interested in the directed development of complex systems driven by 
                  thermodynamic principles. Indeed, in more recent work, Sagan uses the terms gradient reduction and entropy production 
                  interchangeably, suggesting that while the latter may not be maximized it is nonetheless thought to be amplified by 
                  living dissipative systems.

               <text class="enclr">According to Haff, the technosphere is the technological analogue to the 
                  various natural geological paradigms or planetary spheres that constitute and sustain the Earth system, such as the geosphere, 
                  the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, or the biosphere. Put briefly, it is a global interconnected system of technological 
                  artifacts, social structures, and physical infrastructure which constitute the totality of the built human environment, the 
                  particular energy and resource transformations underpinning the system’s metabolic profile, and the emergent principles that 
                  govern our relationship with the system’s functioning.
