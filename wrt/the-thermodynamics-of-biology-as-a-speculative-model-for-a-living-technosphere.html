            <p class="subtitle">Summary
            <p>
            Originating from nineteenth century physics, the concept of entropy—a measure of disorder, randomness, and/or the 
               dissipation of useful energy—underlay a cosmology where order and complexity were seen as highly improbable phenomena 
               in a universe tending toward chaos and disorganisation. Nearly a century later, frameworks were developed for 
               understanding the production of entropy as an enabling feature of self-organized complexity in the natural world. 
               These ideas would contribute to reconciling the origins, development, and evolution of life with the principles of a 
               thermodynamic universe. For some, they also provided the conceptual foundations for theorizing about a natural 
               tendency within our thermodynamic universe—one which drives the development of increasingly complex and ordered 
               systems that amplify overall rates of entropy-production and energy dissipation. In this text I chart a path through 
               the aforementioned ideas and present their relevance in framing a relationship between our technological civilization 
               and the Earth system. I then turn toward the possibility and desirability of instantiating a future technosphere 
               aligned with thermodynamic principles of dissipation and entropy-production, drawing on recent developments in 
               bioengineering and synthetic biology to envision a paradigm where technology becomes living matter itself.

            <p class="subtitle">Biology in the Context of Cosmological Entropy
            <p>
            The concept of entropy originates from nineteenth century thermodynamics and is meant to describe a measure of disorder, 
               randomness, and/or the dissipation of useful energy in a system. In the most general sense, it’s often associated 
               with the idea that natural processes tend to move toward more disorderly states over time. A few simple examples 
               will serve to illustrate this concept. Consider a drop of ink inside a glass of water. Initially, the molecules
               which make up the ink are concentrated in a small area. However, as time passes, they disperse and spread throughout 
               the molecules of water, leading to a more disordered and random distribution. Eventually, the molecules will become 
               uniformly distributed within the glass, reaching a highly entropic state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Another 
               example is observed when you place a warm object, such as a cup of hot tea, inside a room with a lower temperature. 
               Over time, the temperature differential between the cup and the room will become equalized as heat, or thermal 
               energy, from the tea transfers to the surrounding molecules in the air of the room. Similar to the dissipation of 
               ink in water, the temperature of the tea and the room together will eventually reach an equilibrium where the 
               entropy of the total system has been increased and heat has been evenly distributed throughout the space. 
            <p>       
               <img class="txtimg" src="entropy.jpeg">
            <p>
               The latter example of heat flow in a system was precisely what physicist and mechanical engineer Sadi Carnot 
               discovered through his analysis of the efficiency of steam engines <a href="#e">[1]</a>: i.e. that heat always 
               moves down a gradient from hotter to colder states. This basic insight would later become the basis for the 
               second law of thermodynamics. The transformation of thermal energy into mechanical energy—as in the case of 
               a temperature differential powering a steam engine—also, perhaps unsurprisingly, involves the dissipation of 
               useful energy into the environment in the form of heat, becoming spread out into the surroundings and 
               therefore incapable of performing work once more.
            <p>
               In the mid 1800s, Carnot’s idea would be refined by Lord Kelvin (William Thomson) and Rudolf Clausius 
               <a href="#e">[2]</a>, two seminal physicists who were instrumental in unifying the emerging field and providing 
               formal clarity and rigour to the notion of entropy as well as the first two laws of thermodynamics. Together, 
               these two laws describe a universal tendency toward the dissipation of mechanical energy in a cosmos where the 
               total amount of energy is fixed and conserved, while entropy refers to a measure of the energy in a system which 
               is no longer available for work. Physicist Ludwig Boltzmann supplemented these ideas with a statistical 
               interpretation of the second law which defined the tendency for orderly components of a system—particularly 
               molecules in a box—to spread out toward more probable arrangements, or dispersed and disorderly configurations, 
               until they approach a state of elevated entropy and thermodynamic equilibrium. It follows, therefore, that the 
               spontaneous generation of orderly configurations from disordered states was considered by Boltzmann to be infinitely 
               improbable. <a href="#e">[3]</a> These ideas played a significant role in shaping a cosmological model where living systems were 
               understood to be anomalous, improbable, and contingent accidents in a universe running down toward a “heat death” 
               <a href="#e">[4]</a>, with all its parts drifting toward increased disorder and degradation. <a href="#e">[5]</a>
            <p>
               However, unlike purely physical, non-living processes, biological systems seem to strike a peculiar balance between 
               the second law of thermodynamics and the ability to generate, maintain, and propagate complexity and order. This kind 
               of activity appears at odds with the above description of the nature of physical reality: if the state of the 
               universe is thought to be lurching toward an increase in cosmic disorder—as the second law of thermodynamics is 
               often interpreted—why then do we observe an abundance and increasing development of structure, order, organization, 
               and complexity within our planet’s biosphere? 
            <p>
               During the last century, the notion of living systems as open dissipative systems operating in far from equilibrium 
               conditions has emerged as a compelling framework to clarify this enigmatic property of biology and reconcile it with 
               the laws of thermodynamics. <a href="#e">[6]</a>
            <p>
               In this view, living systems engage in a dynamic interplay with their environment, selectively exchanging matter and 
               energy with their surroundings in order to generate the work required to produce and maintain a self-organized state 
               of organic individuation and local entropy minimization. Put plainly, biological systems transform external resources 
               into internal order. 
            <p>
               The process of localized entropy reduction embodied by self-organized living systems is non-contradictory with 
               respect to the physical laws it seems to elude, since the flows of matter and energy which instantiate organic form 
               necessitate the exogenous displacement of entropy from the living process in the form of waste and heat. This in 
               turn, consequently produces a global net increase of entropy within the surroundings of a given biological system. 
               In his pioneering work, <i>What Is Life?</i> physicist Erwin Schrödinger offered one of the earliest articulations of this 
               general idea. In Schrödinger’s words, what a biological system “…feeds upon is negative entropy. Or, to put it less 
               paradoxically, the essential thing in metabolism is that the organism succeeds in freeing itself from all the entropy 
               it cannot help producing while alive.” <a href="#e">[7]</a>
            <p>
               In Schrödinger’s writing, these intuitions about the generation and stabilization of order in organic systems are 
               supported by little empirical knowledge and expressed primarily through statistical equations and speculations about 
               the organism “feeding” upon negative entropy or “sucking orderliness from its environment.” <a href="#e">[8]</a> 
               Schrödinger would ultimately connect these ideas to the unique arrangement of molecules within “aperiodic solids” 
               with hereditary properties, a hypothesis which would later inform geneticists in their understanding of the 
               structure of DNA and its informational qualities. However, subsequent work by researchers in biochemistry, 
               biophysics, theoretical biology, complexity science, and other related areas, would also build upon Schrödinger’s 
               impressions to flesh out a more robust theory of the relationship between non-equilibrium thermodynamics, 
               self-organization, metabolism, and the complexity and order found in biological systems. 
            <p>
               In the following section, I turn to some of this work to provide an overview of the entangled and dialectic nature 
               of entropy and self-maintenance, organized complexity, and life. In doing so, I will highlight a spectrum of 
               self-organizing processes by tracing a continuum from simple dissipative systems to the thermodynamic principles 
               underpinning the activity and organization of living systems.

            [4] Boltzmann uses the term “thermal death” in his 1886 essay <i>The Second Law of Thermodynamics</i>, while others like 
               physicist Hermann Von Helmholtz, in his 1854 lecture <i>On the Interaction of Natural Forces</i>, referred to Lord Kelvin’s 
               work in identifying the conditions for a universe threatened with “eternal death” or “condemned to a state of eternal 
               rest.” Hermann von Helmholtz, <i>Science and Culture: Popular and Philosophical Essays</i>, ed. David Cahan (University of 
               Chicago Press, 1995). The impact these ideas had on intellectual culture may have been existentially profound. For 
               instance, in correspondence with physicist John Tyndall, philosopher and scientist Herbert Spencer wrote “your 
               assertion that when equilibrium was reached life must cease, staggered me. Indeed, not seeing my way out of the 
               conclusion, I remember being out of spirits for some days afterwards.” David Duncan, <i>Life and Letters of Herbert 
               Spencer</i> (New York: Appleton and Company, 1908). Charles Darwin himself wrote of the “intolerable thought that … 
               all sentient beings are doomed to complete annihilation.” Charles Darwin and Nora Darwin Barlow, <i>The Autobiography 
               of Charles Darwin, 1809-1882</i> (London: Collins, 1958). Scholarship has also shown the effects of nineteenth century 
               thermodynamics on philosophical discussion concerning time, cosmology, and ethics among thinkers such as Eugen 
               Dühring, Friedrich Engels, Eduard von Hartmann, and especially Friedrich Nietzsche. Joel White, “How Does One
