     Hierarchical Transitions and the Rules of the Technosphere
  </div>
  <div class="p">
     Last year I had an opportunity to attend an Environmental Humanities graduate seminar at the University of British Columbia with the 
        brilliant <a href="https://mcmaster.academia.edu/DerekWoods">Derek Woods</a>. Due to a full course load I was unable to register, 
        but Derek invited me to sit in during any session I‚Äôd like, if I found the material interesting and relevant to my research. The 
        topic for the class I dropped in on was ‚ÄúPlanetary Technics.‚Äù During the seminar discussions I started contemplating some hazy 
        connections between certain themes in a paper we‚Äôd read about large-scale technological systems (which I‚Äôll introduce in the 
        following section) and some ideas in theoretical biology about the dynamics of collective interaction and major hierarchic 
        transitions. The following text is an attempt to flesh out these conceptual relationships in some more detail. 
     <p>
     This piece is a work in progress. Initially, I‚Äôd only intended to engage with two resources, one text and one lecture, putting them in 
        dialogue with one another to tease out their resemblances and chart future research directions. Naturally, as I was writing I continued 
        to encounter new references that complemented this project and new texts, ideas, and thinkers began to orbit around my efforts. I‚Äôve 
        done my best to integrate some of these new resources into the text, but it‚Äôs definitely far from complete. My hope is that I‚Äôll 
        continue developing this line of thought long after these texts have been shared with you here, especially as it has become increasingly 
        apparent to me that this topic is much richer than I‚Äôd first imagined. Anyways, let me kick things off. 
     <p style="font-size: 30px; padding-bottom: 5px; border-bottom: 1.5px dotted black">Introducing the Technosphere
     <p>
     For Derek‚Äôs seminar that week, the required readings touched on a range of topics related primarily to technology, media, geology, ecology, 
        capitalism, and the¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere">noosphere</a>. Among these publications was¬†
        <a href="https://cee.duke.edu/faculty/peter-haff">Peter Haff</a>‚Äòs¬†<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053019614530575">Humans 
        and Technology in the Anthropocene: Six Rules</a>, a fascinating paper on the quasi-autonomous dynamics of planetary-scale technological systems. 
        In the text, Haff attempts to encapsulate said dynamics using the following six rules:
     <p>
     <p style="margin-left: 30px"> 
        ‚ë† The rule of inaccessibility 
     <br>
        ‚ë° The rule of impotence 
     <br>
        ‚ë¢ The rule of control 
     <br> 
        ‚ë£ The rule of reciprocity 
     <br> 
        ‚ë§ The rule of performance 
     <br>
        ‚ë• The rule of provision 
     </p>
     <p>
     Each of these rules express an important feature of large-scale technological systems which defines how humans are compelled to operate in 
        relation to them. While there are many ways of conceiving of something as general as ‚Äúlarge-scale technological systems‚Äù, Haff‚Äôs specific 
        subject of interest is what he calls the <i>technosphere</i>. Let me start off by quickly describing what exactly this means so I can set 
        the stage for the connections I‚Äôm interested in exploring between his work and the idea of hierarchic transitions in biology.
     <p>
     In an academic context, the word ‚Äútechnosphere‚Äù seems to make its first appearance in a <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1109/MSPEC.1968.5214690">
        1968 text</a> by biomedical engineer and biological control-theory researcher J. H. Milsum. Although Haff has certainly made the term his 
        own through a number of publications produced in the last decade or so (see e.g. <a href="www.pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/Haff 2013 Technology as a Geological Phenomenon.pdf">
        1</a> and <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1177/2053019616677743">2</a>), many of which were thematically allied with a growing literature on 
        the Anthropocene. For Haff, the technosphere is said to be the technological analogue to the various natural geological paradigms, or 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_Earth_sciences#Earth's_spheres">planetary spheres</a>, that constitute and sustain the Earth 
        system, such as the geosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, or the biosphere. Haff notes, for instance, that all of the aforementioned 
        systems are to some degree global in their extent, autonomous, and involve a widespread appropriation of resources. More specifically, the 
        technosphere can be understood as:
      
     <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        A global interconnected system of 
     </p>
     <br style="margin-left: 50px">
        ‚óè Technical artifacts 
     <br>
        ‚óè Complex social structures
     <br>        
        ‚óè Physical infrastructure 
     <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        which characterize
     </p>
     <br style="margin-left: 50px">
        ‚óè The totality of the built human environment
     <br>
        ‚óè The particular energy and resource transformations underpinning the system‚Äôs ‚Äúmetabolic‚Äù profile
     <br>        
        ‚óè The emergent principles that govern our relationship with it, broadly speaking. 
     
     <p>
     As evidenced by this definition, the technosphere is not simply the aggregate of all technological objects‚Äì‚Äìmuch like the biosphere is not the 
        mere sum of all planetary biomass‚Äì‚Äìbut rather has dynamic emergent properties that result from the organization of its various components 
        and the associations between them, including constraints, incentives, deterrents, and other relational processes associated with the system‚Äôs 
        functioning. I‚Äôll return to this point in more detail later on.
