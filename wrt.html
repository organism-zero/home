     Hierarchical Transitions and the Rules of the Technosphere
  </div>
  <div class="p">
     Last year I had an opportunity to attend an Environmental Humanities graduate seminar at the University of British Columbia with the 
        brilliant <a href="https://mcmaster.academia.edu/DerekWoods">Derek Woods</a>. Due to a full course load I was unable to register, 
        but Derek invited me to sit in during any session I‚Äôd like, if I found the material interesting and relevant to my research. The 
        topic for the class I dropped in on was ‚ÄúPlanetary Technics.‚Äù During the seminar discussions I started contemplating some hazy 
        connections between certain themes in a paper we‚Äôd read about large-scale technological systems (which I‚Äôll introduce in the 
        following section) and some ideas in theoretical biology about the dynamics of collective interaction and major hierarchic 
        transitions. The following text is an attempt to flesh out these conceptual relationships in some more detail. 
     <p>
     This piece is a work in progress. Initially, I‚Äôd only intended to engage with two resources, one text and one lecture, putting them in 
        dialogue with one another to tease out their resemblances and chart future research directions. Naturally, as I was writing I continued 
        to encounter new references that complemented this project and new texts, ideas, and thinkers began to orbit around my efforts. I‚Äôve 
        done my best to integrate some of these new resources into the text, but it‚Äôs definitely far from complete. My hope is that I‚Äôll 
        continue developing this line of thought long after these texts have been shared with you here, especially as it has become increasingly 
        apparent to me that this topic is much richer than I‚Äôd first imagined. Anyways, let me kick things off. 
     <p style="font-size: 30px; padding-bottom: 5px; border-bottom: 1.5px dotted black">Introducing the Technosphere
     <p>
     For Derek‚Äôs seminar that week, the required readings touched on a range of topics related primarily to technology, media, geology, ecology, 
        capitalism, and the¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere">noosphere</a>. Among these publications was
        <a href="https://cee.duke.edu/faculty/peter-haff">Peter Haff</a>‚Äòs¬†<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053019614530575">Humans 
        and Technology in the Anthropocene: Six Rules</a>, a fascinating paper on the quasi-autonomous dynamics of planetary-scale technological systems. 
        In the text, Haff attempts to encapsulate said dynamics using the following six rules:
     <p>
     <p style="margin-left: 30px"> 
        ‚ë† The rule of inaccessibility 
     <br>
        ‚ë° The rule of impotence 
     <br>
        ‚ë¢ The rule of control 
     <br> 
        ‚ë£ The rule of reciprocity 
     <br> 
        ‚ë§ The rule of performance 
     <br>
        ‚ë• The rule of provision 
     </p>
     <p>
     Each of these rules express an important feature of large-scale technological systems which defines how humans are compelled to operate in 
        relation to them. While there are many ways of conceiving of something as general as ‚Äúlarge-scale technological systems‚Äù, Haff‚Äôs specific 
        subject of interest is what he calls the <i>technosphere</i>. Let me start off by quickly describing what exactly this means so I can set 
        the stage for the connections I‚Äôm interested in exploring between his work and the idea of hierarchic transitions in biology.
     <p>
     In an academic context, the word ‚Äútechnosphere‚Äù seems to make its first appearance in a <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1109/MSPEC.1968.5214690">
        1968 text</a> by biomedical engineer and biological control-theory researcher J. H. Milsum, although Haff has certainly made the term his 
        own through a number of publications produced in the last decade or so (see e.g. <a href="www.pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/Haff 2013 Technology as a Geological Phenomenon.pdf">
        1</a> and <a href="https://sci-hub.ru/10.1177/2053019616677743">2</a>), many of which were thematically allied with a growing literature on 
        the Anthropocene. For Haff, the technosphere is said to be the technological analogue to the various natural geological paradigms, or 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_Earth_sciences#Earth's_spheres">planetary spheres</a>, that constitute and sustain the Earth 
        system, such as the geosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, or the biosphere. Haff notes, for instance, that all of the aforementioned 
        systems are to some degree global in their extent, autonomous, and involve a widespread appropriation of resources. These general commonalities
        aside, the technosphere can be understood more specifically as: 
      
     <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        A global interconnected system of 
     </p>
     <p style="margin-left: 50px">
        ‚óè Technical artifacts 
     <br>
        ‚óè Complex social structures
     <br>        
        ‚óè Physical infrastructure 
     </p>
     <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        which characterize
     </p>
     <p style="margin-left: 50px">
        ‚óè The totality of the built human environment
     <br>
        ‚óè The particular energy and resource transformations underpinning the system‚Äôs ‚Äúmetabolic‚Äù profile
     <br>        
        ‚óè The emergent principles that govern our relationship with it, broadly speaking. 
     </p>
     <p>
     As evidenced by this definition, the technosphere is not simply the aggregate of all technological objects‚Äì‚Äìmuch like the biosphere is not the 
        mere sum of all planetary biomass‚Äì‚Äìbut rather has dynamic emergent properties that result from the organization of its various components 
        and the associations between them, including constraints, incentives, deterrents, and other relational processes associated with the system‚Äôs 
        functioning. I‚Äôll return to this point in more detail later on. 
     <p>
     We can get a more comprehensive view of what is meant by the technosphere by turning to the following passage from a 2014 text authored by Haff, 
        titled <a href="https://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/Haff 2013 Technology as a Geological Phenomenon.pdf">‚ÄúTechnology as a Geological Phenomenon: 
        Implications for Human Well-Being‚Äù</a>:
     
     <p style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 22px">
     ‚Äú‚Ä¶the set of large-scale networked technologies that underlie and make possible rapid extraction from the Earth of large quantities of free energy
        and subsequent power generation, long distance, nearly instantaneous communication, rapid long-distance energy and mass transport, the existence
        and operation of modern governmental and other bureaucracies, high-intensity industrial and manufacturing operations including regional, 
        continental and global distribution of food and other goods, and a myriad additional ‚Äòartificial‚Äô or ‚Äònon-natural‚Äô processes without which 
        modern civilization and its present 7 √ó 109 human constituents could not exist. If the term ‚Äòanthroposphere‚Äô is meant to emphasize the role 
        of human beings as causative agents responsible for Earth transformations that define the Anthropocene, the use of ‚Äòtechnosphere‚Äô suggests a 
        more detached view of an emerging geological process that has entrained humans as essential components that support its dynamics.‚Äù  
     </p>
     
     <p>
     This quote largely focuses on the many processes enabled by our planetary system of interrelated technological artifacts, while the following excerpt 
        from his more recent text adds a bit of extra detail regarding the artifactual subsystems which the technosphere comprises, i.e. the various 
        contemporary networked technologies nested within the global system:
            
     <p style="margin-left: 30px; font-size: 22px">
     ‚ÄúThe technosphere includes the world‚Äôs large-scale energy and resource extraction systems, power generation and transmission systems, communication,
        transportation, financial and other networks, governments and bureaucracies, cities, factories, farms and myriad other ‚Äòbuilt‚Äô systems, as well
        as all the parts of these systems, including computers, windows, tractors, office memos and humans. It also includes systems which traditionally
        we think of as social or human-dominated, such as religious institutions or NGOs. The Haber-Bosch process and associated technologies, 
        responsible through synthetic fixation of nitrogen and distribution of resulting fertilizers for providing about 40% of the world‚Äôs dietary 
        protein (Smil, 2002), is a specific example of a globally distributed component of the technosphere.‚Äù
     </p>
     
     <p>
     These are, of course, two sides of the same coin‚Äì‚Äìno strict boundaries demarcate each category, both are more-or-less continuous and integrated 
        in each of the descriptions above. What‚Äôs important to grasp is that both of these texts invite us to re-conceptualize what sort of component 
        systems and processes a large-scale technological system might be thought to include. Especially ones which may not intuitively have such 
        associations, from relatively simple products like office memos and fertilizer, to complex intergenerational socio-cultural forms like religious
        institutions, cities, and governments, and most notably the human subjects which we assume for the most part to be the primary causal agents 
        at the centre of all this.
